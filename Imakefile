XCOMM
XCOMM This is the top-level Imakefile for the Zebra distribution.
XCOMM It is modeled after the top-level Imakefile of the MIT X11R5
XCOMM distribution.

#if BuildRDSS
    RDSSSUBDIRS = util ui

XCOMM Note that for distributions, Makefile should be a copy of 
XCOMM Makefile.ini and NOT the Makefile created by imake.  The tarfile
XCOMM target copies Makefile.ini over Makefile automatically, and
XCOMM adds Makefile to the distfiles target.

      DISTFILES = Imakefile Makefile.ini /*Makefile*/ ChangeLog

XCOMM From the top-level directory, the default behavior will be the same
XCOMM as the "Everything" target, i.e. make sure all Makefiles are
XCOMM up-to-date, do includes, depends, and finally install.  The
XCOMM difference between World and Everything is that Everything does not
XCOMM do a clean first.
XCOMM 
XCOMM If someone really wants to do an 'all', they have to ask for it 
XCOMM explicitly.  Now that UseInstalledZebra exists and can be set to NO,
XCOMM a 'make all' is a reasonable thing to do.

 * This is the top-level rule for generating tar files of the distributed
 * files.  The list of files to tar is gotten from the distfiles target.
 * The name of the tarfile can be changed by setting the TARFILE variable
 * on the command line.
 *
 * The -s (silent) option is necessary to get GNU make to not print out
 * its commands for automatically checking for or checking out files.
 * This option is compatible with Sun's make, but others...?
 * Since development is being done on Suns, this is not much of a concern.
 *
 * The 'source' target packages the source distribution by default.
 * The 'binary' target defaults to packaging the binary directories.
 * To include other directories such as project, document, or
 * binary directories, set DISTSUBDIRS and DISTFILES on the command line
 * and use the 'tarfile' target.  See binary and source for examples.
 * Setting DISTSUBDIRS to empty essentially disables the 'make distfiles'
 * and tars only the files and whole directories given in DISTFILES.
 * DISTFILES paths must be relative to the top directory.  Set TARDEST
 * to write the tar file somewhere other than the top directory.
