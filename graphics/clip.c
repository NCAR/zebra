/*
 * A lot of the clipping algorithm used here comes from "Principles of
 * Interactive Computer Graphics," by William Newman and Robert Sproull.
 *
 * The first derivation from that work is this macro, which creates a four
 * bit pattern which describes the relationship of a given point to the
 * clip window.  It divides the world up like this:
 *
 *			|        |
 *		  1001	|  1000  |  1010
 *			|        |
 *		--------+--------+--------
 *			|        |
 *		  0001	|  0000  |  0010
 *			|        |
 *		--------+--------+--------
 *			|        |
 *		  0101	|  0100  |  0110
 *			|        |
 *
 * where the center box is the clip window.
 *
 * The nifty features of this encoding are (1) lines that do not need to be
 * clipped have codes of zero for both endpoints, and (2) lines for which the
 * intersection of the two codes is NOT zero are completely outside the 
 * window, and can be ignored.
