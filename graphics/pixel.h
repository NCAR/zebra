/*
 * Pixel maps are stored in a slightly nonstandard way.  While storage
 * as straight rastor info may seem appealing, it turns out to be better
 * to keep this data in rectangular chunks.  This scheme helps to cut
 * back on page faulting, and also helps in partial updates.
 *
 * The actual block size is device dependant, and is found in the actual
 * device structure.
 *
 * Data within a block is stored as rastor lines.  Since some displays
 * like to put the origin on top, and others on the bottom, we are preprepared
 * to stack rastors from the top down, or the reverse.
