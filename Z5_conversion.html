<font color="#000099">Converting Zebra Configurations For Use With Zebra
5</font></h1></center>
Zebra 5 contains a number of enhancements, some of which are incompatible
with older project configuration files. Project configurations distributed
with version 5 have already been converted to work with it, but users with
custom configurations will need to update them in order to use them with
the Zebra version 5 software. Below are the changes necessary to convert
old configurations for use with the new Zebra. It is hoped that most of
these changes can be made via simple translations mapping old concepts
onto new.
<h2>
Data Store Daemon</h2>
The data store daemon has some changes that will require modifications
to
<i>all</i> old configurations. The daemon configuration file, generally
named <tt>ds.config</tt> is be the target of the necessary changes for
the daemon. The old concept which allowed just one "local" data repository
and one optional "remote" repository has been replaced by a more general
concept of data "sources". A source is simply a directory which contains
subdirectories with data files for one or more of the platforms known to
the data store daemon, and certain attributes regarding file constancy
and handling can be assigned to a source. At least one source must be defined,
and in general only one is used (corresponding to the old "local" data
repository). However, now up to nine additional data sources may be defined
for a total of up to ten sources.
<p>The commands used in the daemon configuration file for defining a source
are as follows
<center><table WIDTH="85%" NOSAVE >
<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE><tt>source &lt;source_name></tt></td>

<td>Begin source definition, with the name of the source.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>directory &lt;dir></tt></td>

<td>Set the top-level directory of the source.</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE><tt>cachefile &lt;filename></tt></td>

<td NOSAVE>(optional) Set the location of the source's cache file. The
file name specified can be a relative path (which will be taken with respect
to the source's top level directory) or an absolute path. The default value
is <tt>Zebra.cache</tt>.</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td><a NAME="FileConst"></a><tt>FileConst true|false</tt></td>

<td NOSAVE>(optional) This is an efficiency flag which may be set if data
files within the source are essentially atomic, i.e., they come and go
as whole units, rather than growing or shrinking. This flag defaults to
false.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="DirConst"></a><tt>DirConst true|false</tt></td>

<td>(optional) This is an efficiency flag which may be set if the data
store can consider the entire source to be effectively constant. This flag
defaults to false.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a NAME="DelayDataDirs"></a><tt>DelayDataDirs true|false</tt></td>

<td>(optional) When this flag is true, a new directory will be created
for a plaform only when needed for writing files. Otherwise, directories
are created at daemon startup for all platforms which do not already have
them. This flag defaults to true.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>RememberAll true|false</tt></td>

<td>(optional) When this flag is set, the daemon will not remove files
from the source's cache if it finds they are no longer on the disk. This
flag defaults to false.</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE><a NAME="PlatDir"></a><tt>PlatDir &lt;plat> &lt;dir></tt></td>

<td>(optional) Set the directory where a given platform's files are stored.
The directory specified can be a relative path (which will be taken with
respect to the source's top level directory) or an absolute path. The default
is to use the platform's name as the directory name.</td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE><tt>endsource</tt></td>

<td>Finish source definition</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
Here are a couple of example source definitions, one simple and one more
complex:
<blockquote><tt>source main</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directory /data/myproject</tt>
<br><tt>endsource</tt>
<p><tt>source another</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directory /data/another/top/directory</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DirConst true</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RememberAll false</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ! Platforms grib1_sfc and grib2_sfc share directories</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ! with their non-surface counterparts</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PlatDir grib1_sfc grib1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PlatDir grib2_sfc grib2</tt>
<br><tt>endsource</tt></blockquote>
An additional daemon change resulting from the move to sources is that
file cache handling is quite different. Previously, a file cache was only
written upon shutdown of the data store daemon (if this option was configured)
or when the daemon was specifically told to write a cache. Now the persistent
file cache is continuously updated, removing the need for some cache-related
configuration variables. Also, some variables affecting interpretation
of the cache have moved from being global to being specified on a source-by-source
basis.
<p>Below is a list of old data store daemon configuration variables that
need to change or go away, with the necessary translations.

<tr NOSAVE>

<h2>
Graphics Process</h2>
Changes have been made in Zebra 5 that also affect data store client programs.
The new field derivation capability includes generalized field name strings,
which can contain simple name, type, units, and long description information.
These new strings can cause problems with some old configurations because
they may contain embedded spaces that will confuse or break certain functions.
In general it is only necessary to modify the problem functions so that
they quote field name strings before passing them on. For most users, only
files associated with Zebra's graphics process, gp, will show any of these
problems. Within a project configuration directory, the files used by gp
are generally
<tt>gp.init</tt> and all files in the project's <tt>modules</tt>
directory. Here's an example of a problem function:
<blockquote><tt>procedure my_set_zfield zfld string</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; parameter #icon_component z-field #zfld</tt>
<br><tt>endprocedure</tt></blockquote>
and a fixed version:
<blockquote><tt>procedure my_set_zfield zfld string</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local qzfld quote(zfld)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameter #icon_component z-field #qzfld</tt>
<br><tt>endprocedure</tt></blockquote>
Also, problems may arise when building special plot description parameters
that contain a field name as part of the parameter name. These parameters
must use just the simple field name and not the new full field string.
Most often these special parameters are defined for setting plotting limits
for a given field. For example, a contour plot of field <tt>tdry[T][degC][ambient
temperature]</tt> will look for plot description parameter <tt>tdry-step</tt>,
and not <tt>tdry[T][degC][ambient temperature]-step</tt> . If a function
is building these &lt;field><tt>-center</tt>, &lt;field><tt>-step</tt>,
or similar parameters, it must be careful not to use the full field string
to build them. For this purpose, a new function SimpleFieldName() is provided
for stripping the simple field name from the full description string. Here
is an example old function that would need to be changed:
<blockquote><tt>procedure set-field-center-step center string step string</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local fname PDParam(icon_component, "field")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local param concat(fname, "-center")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameter #icon_component #param #center</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local param concat(fname,"-step")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameter #icon_component #param #step</tt>
<br><tt>endprocedure</tt></blockquote>
and a fixed version:
<blockquote><tt>procedure set-field-center-step center string step string</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local fname SimpleFieldName(PDParam(icon_component,
"field"))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local param concat(fname, "-center")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameter #icon_component #param #center</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local param concat(fname,"-step")</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameter #icon_component #param #step</tt>
<br><tt>endprocedure</tt></blockquote>
Another change which may require updating your <tt>gp.init</tt>file is
that the old <tt>field</tt> and
<tt>alias</tt> commands in <tt>gp</tt>
are deprecated and should be removed or replaced.&nbsp; For most <tt>gp.init</tt>
files, this simply means removing the automatic loading of the old <tt>FieldDefs</tt>
file, which uses the <tt>field</tt> and <tt>alias</tt> commands.&nbsp;
The loading of <tt>FieldDefs</tt> often
<br>looks like this in old <tt>gp.init</tt> files:
<blockquote><tt>!</tt>
<br><tt>! Get our field definitions.</tt>
<br><tt>!</tt>
<br><tt>set DefFile (concat (concat (c$libdir, "/"), "FieldDefs"))</tt>
<br><tt>read #DefFile</tt></blockquote>
Just remove these lines from your <tt>gp.init</tt>.&nbsp; The most obvious
problem that will arise if a <tt>FieldDefs</tt> file is loaded
<br>under Zebra 5 will be repeated messages in the event logger saying:
"<tt>F_Alias() is no more, so stop calling it!</tt>".&nbsp; If you see
this message, there is likely a <tt>FieldDefs</tt> or similar file being
read via <tt>gp.init</tt>.
<p>If you still need the function of the old <tt>alias</tt> command, a
simple field derivation can be used in its place.&nbsp; For example, if
for platform <tt>myplat</tt> you need to the name <tt>altitude</tt> to
be an alias for existing field
<tt>alt</tt>, the old <tt>alias</tt> command
(which applied to <i>all</i> platforms) was:
<blockquote><tt>alias altitude alt</tt></blockquote>
This is now replaced by creating the file &lt;project><tt>/derivs/myplat</tt>
and adding the line:
<blockquote><tt>altitude = alt;</tt></blockquote>
which will crate an alias that applies only to <tt>myplat</tt>.
<p>The old <tt>field</tt> command has no substitute in Zebra5's <tt>gp</tt>.
<h2>
Display Manager</h2>
One small change is recommended for display manager control files <tt>dm.config</tt>
and <tt>IconBar</tt>.&nbsp; Some of these files set the variable <tt>ui$icon_directory</tt>;
often this is done in IconBar with a line like:
<blockquote><tt>set ui$bitmap_directory concat(c$libdir, "/icons")</tt></blockquote>
It is recommended instead to use the variable ui$bitmap_path, which can
give a number of directories to search for icons and bitmaps, and to set
this variable in dm.config (rather than IconBar) as follows:
<blockquote><tt>set ui$bitmap_path concat3("./icons,",c$libdir, "/icons")</tt></blockquote>
This will make the display manager look for icons first in the project's
<tt>icons</tt>
directory, and then in &lt;zebra_lib><tt>/icons</tt>.
