First unpack the archive, and go to the directory which is
created:

	For the .gz distribution:
	$ gunzip -c rdsslibs-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -

	For the .Z distribution:
	$ uncompress -c rdsslibs-<version>.tar.Z | tar xvf -

	$ cd rdsslibs-<version>

For a default installation, with files installed under /usr/local,
the following is all that is necessary:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

To install under a directory other than /usr/local, use the "--prefix"
option for configure:

	$ ./configure --prefix=<dir>
