RdssMenu and SmeMenu Changes
----------------------------

rdssMenu{.h,.c,P.h} capitalized to become RdssMenu{.h,.c,P.h} Yeah, this
might require lots of changes in UI source's include directives, but the
names really should be capitalized.

SmeMenu no longer uses popdown callbacks to make sure all menu shells
in the cascade get popped down on a <BtnUp>.  Instead, the SmeMenu's
Unhighlight method explicitly calls its popup menu shell's 'unhighlight'
action and then explicitly pops down the shell.

When a SmeMenu creates a menu popup shell, the shell's <BtnUp> translation
is overridden to just "<BtnUp>: notify()", removing the calls to
"MenuPopdown()" and "unhighlight()".  Because all of the sub-menus are
popped up XtGrabNonexclusive, all <BtnUp> events are echoed ('remapped') to
the spring-loaded shell at the top of the modal cascade (the one popped up
with XtGrabExclusive).  This activates that shell's 'unhighlight' method,
which then traverses the cascade of SmeMenuObjects and RdssMenu shells
popping down shells and calling 'unhighlight' methods.

The original fix to the "LeaveNotify event in parent menu shell when
SmeMenu child pops-up sub-menu" was not complete.  A <BtnUp> somewhere
would call Unhighlight() in the top menu, but if the event occurred inside
the submenu, the SmeMenu object would ignore it by assuming it was from an
errant LeaveNotify.  The call to SmeMenuPoppedUp() would then return true
and entry_set would not get set to NULL as it should have.  So... the
RdssMenu's Unhighlight was made more intelligent, only calling a SmeMenu
object's Unhighlight when positive that is what is intended.  The
QueryPointer in SmeMenu's Unhighlight could then be removed.

The test menu is now in the file 'menu' named 'menu'.  Depth of about 5 or
6 menus I think.  And in a little testing I've seen no XtRemoveGrab
warnings.

A SmeMenu entry now reverses video on any highlight call, and the menu
pops up when the cursor is 40 pixels to the right.  The menu title pops up
underneath the cursor.  I think this behavior looks nicer, but it could
be changed.  40 may even be too much, now that things work as they should
anyway.

The works/ directory is as things were after the first fix to the
"LeaveNotify" problem.  1.1/ contains preliminary changes such as file name
changes.  1.2/ contains the whole shibbang described above.

Some debugging macros were added.  Beaucoup messages get printed (some may
even be helpful) if DEBUG is defined in SmeMenu.c and RdssMenu.c. If so,
ignore the XtName() argument type warnings.

1.4  -- Everything up to but not including the XWarpPointer changes

1.5  -- Ongoing work to make XWarpPointer for menus in lower-right corner work

1.6  -- XWarpPointer works, XtRemoveGrab warning fixed, actions added,
        GetEventEntry() bug fixed, works in principle, but still a couple
        bugs to fix and some coding to clean up.

	Some drastic changes had to be made to see this stuff work.  Warping
	the pointer appears to work only if the submenu is popped up *before*
	actually warping the pointer.  The leave event in the parent menu is
	ignored because the submenu's MenuPoppedUp() returns true, and the
	submenu gets the enter event at the pointer's destination rather than some
	other previously-popped-up menu.  Hence to warp the pointer, the
	position and popup actions can be done spearately as was the tradition.
	[Version 1.7 below makes access to the simultaneous position and popup
	functionality more sophisticated than the methods kludged in this version.]

	The XtRemoveGrab warning occurs because of the ordering of actions in the
	<BtnUp> event translation in the RdssMenu.  XtPopdown() calls XtRemoveGrab(),
	and XtRemoveGrab() removed not only the grab on the window being popped down
	but also on any descendants of the window in the modal cascade (which
	makes sense).  So the remapped <BtnUp> event which gets sent to the top
	of the cascade causes the top window to pop down and the grab to be removed
	from all other windows in the cascade.  So when each of these windows
	pops down, and XtRemoveGrab is called for each window and its descendants,
	the grab has previously been removed and the error is generated.  So the fix
	is popping down the windows from the lowest level (greatest depth) to the
	highest level (initial pop-up, spring-loaded menu with XtGrabExclusive
	(the rest have XtGrabNonexclusive)).  However, this causes problems.
	When a submenu popsdown while the cursor is inside it and over the parent
	menu, the parent menu will get an <EnterNotify> event, which will cause the
	parent menu to highlight() its entry, which can popup the submenu again.
	The parent is then popped down only to leave its submenu stranded.  The
	solution used here is to disable or inhibit highlight() actions while the
	cascade is popping down as a result of a <BtnUp> event.  Two methods:

	1)	Rather than popdown a menu, unmap it so that it gets no more
		events.  Then do the notify() and unhighlight() actions, then
		call MenuPopdown().  The windows will disappear (unmap) from
		top to bottom, but the popdown will be from bottom up.  This
		is a simple solution, but aesthetically it might be nicer to
		see the windows disappear from bottom to top.

	2)	Disable highlighting through some action which sets an internal
		flag.  Any highlights received while the flag is true are
		ignored.  This way the popdowns occur in reverse order, but
		the EnterNotify events caused by submenus popping down do not
		cause any action to be taken by any ancestor menus.

	Functionality for both methods is in place.  The second is currently
	in use.  Example translations for each would be:

    "<EnterWindow>:     highlight()             \n\
     <LeaveWindow>:     unhighlight()           \n\
     <BtnMotion>:       highlight()             \n\
     <BtnUp>:           disable-highlight() notify() \
			unhighlight() MenuPopdown()";

    "<EnterWindow>:     highlight()             \n\
     <LeaveWindow>:     unhighlight()           \n\
     <BtnMotion>:       highlight()             \n\
     <BtnUp>:           unmap() notify() unhighlight() MenuPopdown()";

	The method used in RdssMenu's translations should correspond with
	that used in SmeMenu's unhighlight method.  Unhighlight() popsdown
	a submenu by first calling either of the submenu's "unmap" or
	"disable-highlight" actions.  Then it pops down the submenu.

	Since RdssMenu's Unhighlight() action now ignores <LeaveNotify>
	events in an SmeMenu entry while its submenu is popped up, it is
	possible to leave the right side of an entry without causing an
	unhighlight.  However, due to a bug in GetEventEntry(), a <Motion>
	event at the edge of an entry would be returned as a NULL entry.
	This would cause an unhighlight() action would pop down the
	submenu.  The problem was that GetEventEntry was not taking into
	account its border width when determining whether an event occurred
	inside one of its gadgets.  This has been fixed.


1.7 -- No changes to SmeMenu.c, except debugging undefined.  RdssMenu.c:
	Modularized the menu position, move, and popup procedures and
	re-wrote the PositionMenuAction to take advantage.  Added two
	methods of public access to the PositionAndPopup functionality,
	which takes care of positioning, moving, and popping up an RdssMenu
	with the cursor under the default entry, even if the menu must be
	moved to appear entirely on the screen.  The two methods:

     1)	Action named "PositionAndPopupRdssMenu".  If no argument, tries to
	get the menu name from the menuName of the widget whose
	translations called the action (i.e. a MenuButton).  Otherwise it
	takes a single argument which is the name of the menu.

     2) Public function RdssMenuPositionAndPopup(Widget, XPoint *,
	XtGrabKind).  Intended to be called by SmeMenu objects in modal
	cascades with XtGrabNonexclusive.

	Also, the action "PositionRdssMenu" is now an alias for the
	original position action "RdssPositionSimpleMenu" (either name can
	be used).

	The file uic.ad has been added.  It sets MenuButton translations to
	use the PositionAndPopupRdssMenu() action.  Run 'xrdb -merge
	uic.ad' before running uic> to see its effect on the MenuButton
	popup behavior.


1.8 -- 	There was a problem with re-using the same popup shell in different
	parts of a menu hierarchy.  SmeMenu's highlight method overrides
	the popup shell's <BtnUp> translations to disable the usual 
	unhighlight() and popdown() actions, which will get invoked from 
	above.  However, if the same popup shell is subsequently use as a
	top-level menu, it will need its original translations back.  So
	the SmeMenu widget now has a private structure member called
	"popup_trans" which holds the popup shell's original translations.
	The translations are restored whenever the popup shell is popped
	down.  I think the changes in translations may be entirely 
	unnecessary now that the action order has changed from 
	popdown-notify-unhighlight to notify-unhighlight-popdown.  Without
	the translation change in SmeMenu:Highlight(), there will be some
	calls to unhighlight and popdown from any parent SmeMenu objects
	after the RdssMenu has already popped itself down.  This doesn't
	cause XtRemoveGrab errors because the RdssMenu popping down is at
	the bottom of the modal cascade.

	For now the translation shuffling has been left there.

1.9 --  All of the translation stuff was removed as tests on SmeMenu:1.8.1
	seem to show that it is not necessary, as long as the translations
	are like the defaults coded into RdssMenu.c (i.e. popdowns done
	in post-order traversal of the modal cascade).

----------------
1.10

Finally done away with the pointer warping, making the implementation a
little conformant to the ICCCM.  Two critical ideas were implemented.
First, the EnterWindow event did not to be bound to a highlight() action --
the BtnMotion event suffices.  This prevents submenu entries from
immediately highlighting if they pop-up underneath the pointer.  Second,
rather than warp the pointer at the right edge of the screen to make the
menus fit, the menus are instead placed on the opposite side of the pointer
(ala left-cascading).  The menu must be beyond the pointer, because if the
pointer falls inside the right edge it will likely immediately activate a
menu entry.  To allow the pointer to traverse left into a menu without
unhighlighting it on the way, the menu popup code uses different X limits
for changing pop-up status.  The limit for going from popped up to popping
down is 20 pixels left of the limit for doing the reverse.  Vertical
warping should never have been necessary, and it was definitiely a nuisance
at times.  Now neither horizontal nor vertical warping is required.
