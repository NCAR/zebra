<p><br><H3><a name="H2">2. Introduction 
</a></H3>
<br><p><p align=center><IMG src="LiteClue.gif"><p><p>LiteClue is a widget 
which pops a one line help 
message when the user passes the pointer over another &quot;watched&quot; widget.  This is 
known by various names in the industry such as hints, clues, tips, 
bubble help and balloon help.  
<p>Clues are particularly helpful for push buttons that contain graphic 
pixmaps rather than text.  They obviate the need to place text within graphics 
in the button which creates internationalization problems.  
A clue may be attached to virtually any widget that has a window (no gadgets).  
LiteClue works with Motif but does not require it.  
<p>None of this affects the behaviour of the watched widget itself.  
LiteClue monitors enter and leave events of the watched widget's 
window passively.  
<p>LiteClue relies on EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events for the the widgets 
it is watching.  This will normally prevent clues from poping up 
when the watched widgets are insensitive.  See the function 
<b>XcgLiteClueDispatchEvent</b> for a way to bypass this limitation.  
<p>LiteClue inherits behaviour and ewsources from OverrideShell.  
<p>The class pointer is xcgLiteClueWidgetClass.  
<p>The class name is xcgLiteClue.

</DL><p>LiteClue has been compiled successfully on NCR MPRAS, 
Digital OSF/Unix, ULTRIX (XR4), Linux, VMS and probably many others.  
<p>To build the test program: 
<p><pre>
	xmkmf
	make
</pre><p>For VMS, see the file BUILD.COM.  
<p>LiteClue is designed for X11R4 or higher.  It checks 
XtSpecificationRelease at compile time.  When compiled for X11R5 or 
higher, it uses font sets which gives it good internationalization 
support (see Section <a href="LiteClue.html#H10">10</a> below).  However, you can also force it to 
use font structs instead by setting a compile time variable (see make 
file).  
<p>When using font sets, you may get the message: 
<p><pre>
Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion
Warning: Unable to load any usable fontset
</pre><p>which means that your locale does not support the font's character sets.  
On many machine, the default C locale does not allow 8-bit characters 
or the iso88591 character set required by the default fonts.  
Fix this by setting your LANG environment variable.  For example, on HP-UX 
in the US you set: 
<p><pre>
	LANG=C.iso88591
</pre><p><br><H3><a name="H5">5. Resources

<br><p>LiteClue adds the following resources to those it inherits.  The resource class 
is obtained by replacing the N by a C in the resource name (eg: 
XtNfontSet is the name XtNfontSet is the class.  The access types are 
C (resource may be set at create time), S (may be se using XtSetValues), or 
G (may be read using XtGetValues).

</a></H3>
<br><p>LiteClue contains the following functions that control the widget behaviour.  
<p><H3><a name="H8.1">8.1 XcgLiteClueAddWidget -- Add a widget to be watched.  
</a></H3>
<br><DL COMPACT><DT>
<b>Function</b> 
<DD>
 
A widget will be added to the LiteClue watched list.  
Clues are given for sensitive watched widgets when the pointer enters its 
window.  If the widget is already watched, the passed text replaces its 
current clue text.  
If text is null, the widget is still added, if it is not already 
in the list, but no clue will appear.  Text may be specified 
with XcgLiteClueAddWidget in a subsequent call.  
When text is null and the widget is already in the list, its 
text is not changed.  
When a widget will is added to the watched list, it automatically 
becomes sensitive.  Otherwise, its sensitivity is not changed.  
A watched widget which is not sensitive retains its context but clues 
are suppressed.  
None of this affects the behaviour of the watched widget itself.  
LiteClue monitors enter and leave events of the watched widget's 
window passively.

<b>Function</b> 
<DD>
A widget is deleted from the watched list and its resources are 
freed.  LiteClue is no longer given for the widget.  
If the widget is not watched, nothing is done.  
None of this affects the behaviour of the watched widget itself, just whether 
a clue is poped for the widget.

When a watched widget is sensitive, a clue is poped up when the 
pointer enters its window.  When a watched widget is insensitive, 
the widget is retained in the watched list but no clue is poped.  
The sensitivity of a watched widget relative to clues is set or reset 
by this function.

the widget is retained in the watched list but no clue is poped.  
The sensitivity state of a watched widget relative to clues is returned 
by this function.

</a></H3>
<br><p><DL COMPACT><DT>
<b>Function</b> 
<DD>
This function may be used to enable clues for insensitive watched 
widgets.  Normally, XtAppMainLoop (which calls XtDispatchEvent) will not 
deliver EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events to widgets that are not 
sensitive (XtSetSensitive).  This prevents clues from poping up for these 
widgets.  To bypass this limitation, you can break out XtAppMainLoop and 
add a call to XcgLiteClueDispatchEvent ass follows: 
<p><pre>
MyXtAppMainLoop(XtAppContext app)
{
    XEvent event;
    for (;;) {
        XtAppNextEvent(app, &amp;event);
	XcgLiteClueDispatchEvent(w, event) ;
        XtDispatchEvent(&amp;event);
    }
}
</pre><p><DT>
<b>C-call</b>

Boolean XcgLiteClueDispatchEvent (Widget w, XEvent *event) 
<p><DL COMPACT><DT>
<b>w </b> 
<DD>
LiteClue widget 
<DT>
<b>event </b> 
<DD>
received event, normally from call to XtAppNextEvent.  
</DL><p><DT>
<b>Output</b> 
<DD>
Nothing 
<p><DT>
<b>Return</b>		 
<DD>
 
<DL COMPACT><DT>
True 
<DD>
- event was dispatched to non-sensitive watched widget.  
<DT>
False 
<DD>
- not a EnterNotify or LeaveNotify event or window in 
event is not a non-sensitive watched widget.  
</DL></DL><p><H3><a name="H9">9. Sample Use 
</a></H3>
<br><p>Since LiteClue is a shell widget , you make an instance of the shell 
as in this example: 
<p><pre>
	Widget liteClue, toplevel ;
	...
  	toplevel = XtVaAppInitialize(&amp;AppContext,
	...
	liteClue = XtVaCreatePopupShell( &quot;LiteClue_shell&quot;,
		xcgLiteClueWidgetClass, toplevel, ..., NULL);
</pre><p>If you want to change the font used by LiteClue, you could add 
the fontSet resource at create time as in: 
<p><pre>
#define RES_CONVERT( res_name, res_value) \
       XtVaTypedArg, (res_name), XmRString, (res_value), strlen(res_value) + 1

	liteClue = XtVaCreatePopupShell( &quot;LiteClue_shell&quot;,
		xcgLiteClueWidgetClass, toplevel,
		 RES_CONVERT(XtNfontSet, \
			&quot;-adobe-new century schoolbook-bold-r-normal-*-18-*&quot;),
		NULL);
</pre><p>You need only create a single instance of the widget for the application.  
To attach help to a widget (usually a push button) use 
the function <b>XcgLiteClueAddWidget</b> (Section <a href="LiteClue.html#H8.1">8.1</a>) as in: 
<p><pre>
	button_widg = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(&quot;Button1&quot;, xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
	...
	XcgLiteClueAddWidget(liteClue, button_widg,  &quot;Help Message&quot;, 0, 0);
</pre><p><br>In order to enable clues for insensitive widgets you will need to replace 
the standard call to XtAppMainLoop with the code as illustrated in the 
function <b>XcgLiteClueDispatchEvent</b>.  
<p><br><H3><a name="H10">10. Internationalization 
</a></H3>
<br><p>The LiteClue widget is designed to allow the display of internationalized 
text.  This has been tested on a limited basis with Japanese.  
<p>In order to make use of internationalization, you must have support 
in your operating system for the desired locale and must have the 
needed fonts.  In some cases, you may use the X provided locale 
support instead.  At initialization, you should have code that 
looks something like: 
<p><pre>
	if (setlocale(LC_ALL,&quot;&quot;) == NULL)
		fprintf(stderr, &quot;LiteCluetest: Can't set locale\n&quot;);
	if (!XSupportsLocale())
	{
		fprintf(stderr, &quot;LiteCluetest: X does not support locale\n&quot;);
		setlocale(LC_ALL,NULL) ;
	}
	if (XSetLocaleModifiers(&quot;&quot;) == NULL)
		fprintf(stderr, &quot;LiteCluetest: Can't XSetLocaleModifiers\n&quot;);
</pre><p>If you need the X locale package, add the following: 
<p><pre>
	#define X_LOCALE
	#include &lt;X11/Xlocale.h&gt;
</pre><p><br>LiteClue makes use of the XR5 Font Set technology.  All 
font resources are converted to Font Sets.  For example, for Japanese 
you will need three fonts for each font set: 
<p><pre>
*XcgLiteClue.fontSet: \
-sony-fixed-medium-r-normal--0-110-100-100-c-0-jisx0201.1976-0,\
-adobe-new century schoolbook-medium-r-normal-*-14-*,\
-jis-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-110-100-100-c-160-jisx0208.1983-0
</pre><p>Finally, you must set the environment symbol LANG to the appropriate locale.  
For Japanese, one possibility is &quot;LANG=ja_JP.eucJP&quot;.
