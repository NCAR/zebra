LiteClue is a widget which pops a one line help message when the user
passes the pointer over another "watched" widget. This is known by
various names in the industry such as hints, clues, tips, bubble help
and balloon help.

Clues are particularly helpful for push buttons that contain graphic
pixmaps rather than text. They obviate the need to place text within
graphics in the button which creates internationalization problems. A
clue may be attached to virtually any widget that has a window (no
gadgets). LiteClue works with Motif but does not require it.
