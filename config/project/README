This directory holds the Zeb-specific include files for Imake and
the configuration file 'config.h' which is included by the source
files.  As long as this directory is listed first on imake's list
of include directories, the files here will override any other
imake include files.  Hence you can use either the imake distributed
with Zeb (which is just an exact copy of the MIT X11 distribution),
or you can use a previously installed imake.

Files:
======

Zeb.rules:	Unique Zeb Makefile rules and re-definitions of 
		some of the rule definitions in Imake.rules.

Project.tmpl:	Unique Zeb make(1) variables and definitions which
		are defaulted here.  This file includes the Zeb.rules
		file and the config.h file.  

config.h:	The user-configurable file which defines certain
		choices and configurations available to the
		Zeb installer.  This file is included when creating
		Makefiles and by source files.  Stable copies are
		installed in $(TOP)/include for inclusion by 
		source files.

README:		This file.

README.imake:	Describes the ../imake directory and its role in this
		distribution.

Imakefile.imake: A modified copy of the ../imake directory's Imakefile.
		 See README.imake.

Zeb-Imake.doc:	A guide to imake and its use in the Zeb distribution.

Xosdefs.h:	An X11 include file required by imake; it is included
		directly from this directory when imake is compiled.

site.def:	A site-specific configuration file for overriding some
		of Imake's definitions in Imake.tmpl and <machine>.cf
		files.  See Zeb-Imake.doc.

Imakefile:	The Imakefile for this directory.  It just installs the
		config.h file into the build include directory.
