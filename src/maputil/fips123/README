This directory contains the source code for the FIPS 123 Function Library,
obtained from ftp://sdts.er.usgs.gov/pub/sdts/software/fips123/.
Subdirectory divisions from the original distribution have been removed, as
well as extraneous files such as example data.  In addition, I've added an
Imakefile to make things work more easily in our environment.
