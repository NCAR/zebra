Contents of the directory
=========================

cbd2zebra.c
	Program to convert CBD format CIA World Bank II map files into
	Zebra-usable form.

cbd_world.gif
	GIF image showing coverage of the CIA/CBD dataset.  This is what
	to look at to find that, e.g., Antarctica and Mexico are included in 
	the South America part of the dataset.

DEM_records.txt
	Brief description of the structure of DEM files.

dem2zebra.c
	Program to extract a selected rectangular area from USGS 1:250,000 
	(3 arc second) DEM files into a gridded netCDF file (usable in Zebra).

dlg2zebra.c
	Program to extract a Zebra map of selected features from a directory
	of USGS SDTS DLG files.

dlg_sdts.ps.gz
	Compressed PostScript document "DLG-3 SDTS Transfer Description,"
	describing the SDTS form of USGS DLG data files.

drawmap.c
	Simple map digitizing program which uses the digitizing tablet in the 
	Users' Room.

fips123
	Subdirectory for the FIPS PUB 123 Function Library, used for unpacking
	SDTS files.

map_decimate.c
	Program which applies a filter of user-specified length in km to
	a map to generate a smaller map with coarser resolution.

ncar2zebra.c
	Program to extract a given region from the NCAR Graphics map database
	and convert it to Zebra-usable form.  Except perhaps for making maps
	of large multi-state regions, this should be superceded by dlg2zebra.

rect_filter.c
	Program to extract a specified lat/lon rectangle from the input map
	file.

sdtsdump.c
	Simple SDTS file dumping program.

tablet.c
	Tablet stuff used by drawmap.
