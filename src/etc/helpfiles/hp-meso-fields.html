<h1>Displaying fields in station plots</h1>

<b>Station plots</b> allow the display of (usually) surface data at the
observation location; they are used for mesonet stations, buoys, and
related platforms.  When you add a station plot to a horizontal plot
window, you get something that nominally looks like this:
<blockquote><img src=starrow.gif></blockquote>
i.e. a bare arrow at the station location.  It is possible, however, to
annotate this arrow with up to four fields in the corners around the arrow.
To do so, you need to go to the annotation area on the side of the graphics
window:
<blockquote><img src=stannot.gif></blockquote>
As you move into one of the four "quadrants," it will illuminate:
<blockquote><img src=stannoti.gif></blockquote>
You may then use the middle mouse button to pull up the field menu, getting
something like this:
<blockquote><img src=stmenu.gif></blockquote>
Select a field and release the mouse button.  The display will redraw with
the field annotated in the corresponding corner (and the side annotation
adjusted accordingly):
<blockquote><img src=staquad.gif> ... <img src=stannot2.gif></blockquote>
There are two special fields which appear in the field menu:
<ul>
<li> <tt>None</tt> causes nothing to be plotted in that corner -- it goes
     blank.
<li> <tt>Station</tt> causes the name of each station to be plotted in that
     corner.
</ul>
