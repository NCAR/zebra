<h2>Using Icons in Graphics Windows</h2>
<hr>

Three types of icons may be present in a <a href=graphic-windows.html>
graphics window</a>;

<ol>

<li> The <img src=zeb-icon.gif> icon is always located in the lower left
hand corner of the grahpics display.<p>

<li>The "field" icons at the bottom of each graphics window are used
to control the contents and the plots of the data being displayed in that
window.  There is one icon present for each data field or overlay.<p>

<li>The mouse-sensitive "position icons" are located within a horizontal
plot at the origin of the data platform. Position icons are used to add
data to other graphics windows and to control the plots of the data
displayed in the current graphics window. <p>

</oL>

Each mouse button (left, right, and middle) activates a different menu
within each icon.  These menus are often referred to as the left-button,
middle-button, and right-button pulldown menus. <p>
<h2> The Global Icon </h2>
The <img src=zeb-icon.gif> icon controls
'global' functions that are independent of the
individual platforms being displayed in the window. (NOTE: The Zeb
icon described here is 
located at the lower-left corner of each <a href=graphic-windows.html>
graphics windows </a>, it is NOT located in the 
<a href=iconbar.html>Iconbar</a>.)  The
left-button menu has entries for setting global limits,
popping up the Movie and Overlay Times widgets, and
resetting the window.  The right-button menu usually adjusts
the color and size of the window's top annotation.  The
function of the middle-button menu differs among the types
of plots.  For example in horizontal plots, it selects
between real-time mode and the history times at which data
is available from the base component.  However, for X-Y
Graphs and Time Series Plots the middle-button menu selects
fields for addition to the window. <p>

<h2> The Field Icons </h2>

The rest of the icons in the lower-left corner of the graphics window are
each associated with a specific platform or field and hence are often
called Field icons.  Generally the Field icon menus on the left button
allow users to change <a href=limits.html> plotting limits and intervals
</a>, <a href=disable.html> disable/re-enable data </a>, and move data to
the top or bottom of the display stack.

<p>The middle buttons usually allows
users to change the fields being plotted from a specific platform.  For
example, a mesonet contour of temperature can be changed to a contour of
dewpoint.

<p>
The right button allows modification of miscellaneous items such
as line width, color, and annotation size (see <a href=color-lables.html>
Changing colors and labels </a>.<p>

The field icon's color indicates the state of the data:<p>
<ul>

<li> A dark blue background <img src=iconbar-sat.gif> indicates that the
field represented by the icon is displayed normally. <p>

<li> A red background <img src=iconbar-sat-red.gif> indicates that the data
represented by the icon is displayed but is "old".  The time used for
defining "old" is set in the defaults.pd file.  Generally it is set to be
twice the data report interval (so if satellite data was collected at 30
minute intervals, the icon would turn red when the displayed satellite data
was over an hour old).  The only way to determine the actual time the data
was collected in to popup the <a href=overlay-time.html> overlay times </a>
widget.<p>

<li> A gray background <img src=iconbar-sat-gray.gif> indicates that the
field has been temporarily <a href=disable.html> disabled </a>. The
<tt>Disable/reenable</tt> option on the left-button pull-down menu toggles
between display or no display of the data represented by the icon. <p>

</ul>

<h2> Position Icons </h2> 

Mouse-sensitive position icons allow data to be
added to other windows using the middle mouse button, as well as to perform
miscellaneous tasks such as changing the color and annotation size (similar
to the field icon right mouse button menus). For a more complete
description of their use, see <a href=posicons.html>Position Icons</a>.
