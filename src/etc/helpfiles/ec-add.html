<h1>Adding windows to a display configuration</h1>

Adding new windows to a display configuration is a simple task.
Unfortunately, however, the interface to this capability varies widely
depending on which project setup is in use.  This page will cover all of
the possibilities.

<h2>The configuration editing widget</h2>

If your icon bar has an entry like <tt>Pop up configuration editing
widget</tt> in the global <img src=zeb-icon.gif> or tools <img
src=tools-icon.gif> icon menu, select it now.  You will get the following
widget:
<blockquote><img src=ec-confedit.gif></blockquote>
Click on <tt>New window</tt>, then proceed to the next section.

<h2>The new window widget</h2>

If your iconbar has instead an entry which reads <tt>Add display
window</tt>, select it now.  The new window widget is the same regardless
of whether it came from the configuration editing widget directly or from
the icon bar, and looks like:
<blockquote><img src=ec-newwindow.gif></blockquote>
You will need to choose two things here to create your new graphic window.
First, the window must be assigned a name.  The actual name doesn't matter,
as long as it is not the name of a window which is already on the screen.
If you will be creating a whole series of custom configurations, you will
get better performance out of zeb if you use the same window names in each
configuration.  Second, chose the type of the window from the pulldown menu
on the right.  The list of available types will vary from one project to
another.
<p>
Once you have picked a name and a type, click on <tt>Create Window</tt>.
The widget will disappear, and, shortly, your new graphic window will
appear on the screen.

<h2>New windows directly from the icon bar</h2>

Some project configurations have a cascading menu of window types
accessible directly from the icon bar.  In this case, you need only select
the type of the window to be created, and a name will be assigned
automatically.

<p>
In any case, the new window is pretty much guaranteed to be the wrong size,
and in the wrong place.  You may use your window manager's move and resize
functions to put the window where you want it to end up.
