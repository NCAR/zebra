<h3>Times for Model Data: Issue Time and Valid Time</h3>

One significant difference between dealing with observed and model data is
in specifying the time of the data to be displayed. With observed data,
only one time is associated with each datum: the time at which the
observation was made. (This is a simplification since not all observations
are instantaneous; e.g., a satellite may take many minutes to scan a
complete image. However, for purposes of Zeb, one time is assigned to each
observed datum.) However, with model data two times are used to identify a
datum: an issue time and a valid time. The issue time of a model run is the
time for which the run was initialized, essentially the time at which the
model was run. A given run may then be comprised of a number of different
forecasts, each with a time offset from the issue time of the model
run. Adding an individual forecast's offset to the issue time of the run
gives the valid time for that forecast.<p>

<h3>Time Correspondence Between Observed and Model Data</h3>	

In comparing observed data with model data in Zeb, a choice must be made
regarding how to align times, since the observed data can be matched to
either the issue time or the valid time of model data. The user chooses how
to match data, but as a rule of thumb, observed data will be matched to the
valid time of model data when post-processing, and to the issue time of
model data when working in real-time. <p>

Behind the rule of thumb lie two things. First, in general, the desire is
to compare a model's prediction to what actually happened when the
prediction was valid. This means matching observed data to the model valid
time. In real-time, though, observed data corresponding to model valid time
are not available, since the valid times are typically sometime in the
future. This constrains the user to using observed data corresponding to
the model issue time. <p>

The choice between these two modes of display, matching observed data times
with model valid or issue times, can be made from the model data widget
(see below).<p>

In order to remain consistent with the way Zeb has worked in the past, the
time shown in the upper left of a graphics window will always be the time
of the observed data in the plot. When model data are present in a plot,
and the valid time of the model is different from the issue time, a
separate annotation will be included on the plot indicating the model's
issue and valid times.<p>

<h3> Model Data Widget</h3>

The model data widget provides a means for controlling most time-related
parameters associated with a plot of model data. In general, the widget is
brought up by clicking the right mouse button on any graphics window icon
associated with model data, and selecting Pop up model widget from the
resulting menu. The widget will appear essentially as in the figure,
although the number of frame buttons will vary depending on which model or
models are currently included in the plot. Included in the diagram is a
description of function of each of the controls on the model widget.<p>

<img src=model-widget-title.gif><br>
<b>Title</b>: tells which graphics process owns this model data widget.<p>

<hr><img src=model-widget-one.gif><br>
<b> Model Issue Time</b>: change the date and time here when you wish to see a
different model issue time. The new time is not used until the Apply button
is used.<p>

<b>Apply Button</b>: this button becomes active whenever the model issue time to
the left is different from that in the current plot. Press the button to
apply the new issue time.<p>

<b>Frame Selection Buttons</B>: used to immediately display the associated
forecast time. The currently displayed frame is highlighted in black. There
is one button for each forecast time available in one or more of the models
in the current display.<p>

<img src=model-widget-four.gif>
<B>Frame Include/Exclude Buttons</b>: toggle whether the associated frame will be
included or excluded when a loop is executed. Black indicates the frame
will be included.<p>

<img src=model-widget-five.gif>
<b>Include All/Exclude All Button</b>: used to immediately toggle all frames to
either the include or exclude state for a frame loop.<p>

<hr><img src=model-widget-six.gif><br>

<b>Start Loop Button</b>: starts generation of a frame loop.<p>

<b>Stop Loop Button</b>: halts a running frame loop.<p>

<img src=model-widget-seven.gif>
<b>Frame Step Button</b>: step forward or backward through the forecast times by
clicking here with the left mouse button (for backward) or the right mouse
button (or forward).<p>

<hr><img src=model-widget-eight.gif><br>

<b>Valid/Issue Toggles</b>: these buttons toggle whether observational data will
be selected to match the model issue time or the model valid time. The
black button indicates the current selection.<p>

<b>Frames/Second</b>: set the desired frame rate for the loop here. It will take
effect the next time a loop is started.<p>

<b>Dismiss</b>: pop down this widget.<p>

<h3>Other Model Controls</h3>

For models with many vertical levels, the level displayed is changed using
the up and down cursor keys on the keyboard. It is also possible to use the
PageUp and PageDown keys to move immediately to the highest or lowest level
of the model, respectively.<p>
