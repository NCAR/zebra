<h2>Changing the displayed graphics windows</h2>

A display configuration refers to the number, size and position of windows
that make up the Zeb display.  Several predefined display configurations
have been created and the user may switch between configurations whenever
necessary.  The available configurations are listed in a menu under the Zeb
icon of the IconBar.

To change to a new configuration:
<ul>
<li>Click and hold the left mouse button on the <img src=zeb-icon.gif> or <img
src=configs-icon.gif> icon of the IconBar.<p>

<li>Move the cursor until the desired display configuration is highlighted.
(Note: Display Configurations are recognized by a reference to windows or
the word Configuration in the menu entry.)  The currently selected display
configuration is denoted by an *.<p>

<li>Release the mouse button.<p>
</ul>
While the new configuration is being drawn some or all of the currently
visible windows may disappear.  See <a href=editing-configs.html> Editing
Display Configurations </a> for information on creating new configurations
and modifying pre-defined configurations.<p>
