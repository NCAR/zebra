<h1>Position icons</h1>

Some types of overlays in constant plots can make use of <b>position
icons</b> -- icons which are sensitive to the mouse and which can be used
to control the display.  Such plots include locations, station plots, and
tracks.  Displaying these types of plots is just a matter of getting them
from the icon bar and adding them to a display window, as described
<a href=hp-data.html>here</a>.
<p>
Position icons act in a manner similar to other icons when approached with
the mouse.  If you have a section of the screen which looks like this:
<blockquote><img src=iss-marker.gif></blockquote>
then you move the pointer over the marker, it will illuminate like this:
<blockquote><img src=iss-marker-active.gif></blockquote>
Once the icon lights up, you can find the usual set of menus off the mouse
buttons.  Some of them are just duplicates of the menus found on the icon
at the bottom of the window.  However, the middle mouse button usually has
a menu that looks like this:
<blockquote><img src=iss-aa-menu.gif></blockquote>
This menu allows you to display the data from this station in a different
window.  Select the <tt>display station in other window</tt> entry, then
click on the window where you would like to see the data.  Zeb will try to
display the data in an appropriate manner in the destination window.  For
example, if your platform is a sounding station, you may:
<ul>
<li> Display it as a sounding in a skew-t window
<li> See a trace of one or more fields in a time-series window
<li> See it as a color-coded track in a horizontal window
<li> Display it contoured with wind arrows in a time-height window
</ul>
And so on.  Position icons in horizontal plots are often used as the
mechanism of choice for chosing platforms to plot in other types of
windows.
