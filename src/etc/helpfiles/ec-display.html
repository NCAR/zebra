<title>Recalling a saved display configuration</title>
<h1>Recalling a saved display configuration</h1>

At the current time, zeb is not able to automatically add new display
configurations to the icon bar.  Thus, if you want to bring up your new
configuration, you will actually have to type a command.  Move to the
terminal window in which you originally started zeb, and type the
following:
<pre>
	DM&gt; display name
</pre>
Where <tt>name</tt> is the name under which you saved your display
configuration.  (The <tt>DM&gt;</tt> is the display manager prompt; do not
type it yourself).
<p>
If you always want to see a particular display configuration when you start
up zeb, assign the environment variable <tt>DEFAULT_CONFIG</tt> to be the
name of that configuration.

<h2>Adding a configuration to the icon bar</h2>

This is a (slightly) advanced topic for those who wish to add a new display
configuration to the icon bar.  This modification is an easy text editing
task.  The steps are:
<ul>
<li> Be sure that the display configuration has been saved in a directory
     that is accessible by all users.  Otherwise you will create
     frustration for other zeb users who will see the new menu entry, but
     who will be unable to invoke it.
<p>
<li> Move to the project directory, and edit the file <tt>IconBar</tt> with
     your favorite text editor.
<p>
<li> Not too far from the top is the definition of the menu containing all
     of the display configurations.  You will see a number of lines like:
<pre>
	entry 'Wide-screen satellite' 'display wide' \
		(dm$config = 'wide')
</pre>
<p>
<li> Duplicate one of these (pairs of) lines.  Replace the name of the
     configuration with the name of the new one, and replace the first
     quoted string with a short, textual description of your configuration.
<p>
<li> Be sure of a couple of things: (1) maintain the quotes as shown above,
     and (2) the backslash must appear at the end of the first line.
<p>
<li> Save the file, and you are done.  You will need to restart zeb before
     the new menu entry is available.
</ul>
For the curious: the keyword <tt>entry</tt> denotes an entry in the
pulldown menu.  The first parameter (quoted string) is the text which
appears in the menu; the second is the <tt>display</tt> command which is
invoked when this menu entry is selected, and the third entry (the stuff in
parentheses) is a logical test which assigns a marker next to this entry
when this configuration is the one currently being displayed.
