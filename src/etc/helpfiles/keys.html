<h1>Keystrokes and Mouse Button Functions</h1>

Zebra uses "button-to-command mappings" to map keystrokes and
mouse button clicks in a graphics window to many of the
graphics window functions.  To perform one of the actions
listed in the following table, simply press the indicated
key or mouse button while the cursor is in the graphics
window where you wish the action performed.  In the table,
a letter refers to the key on the keyboard.  LMB indicates
left mouse button, MMB the middle, and RMB the right. 
Prepending Shift- to the button name indicates that the
shift key should be held down while the mouse button is
pressed.  So Shift-LMB means 'hold the shift key down and
press the left mouse button.'  Function keys are denoted
by 'Fn'.<b>
