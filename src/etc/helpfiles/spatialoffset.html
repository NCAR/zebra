<title>Shifting data in horizontal plots</title>
<h1>Shifting data in horizontal plots</h1>

On occasion it is necessary to shift data spatially in a horizontal plot.
Situations where you might want to do this include:
<ul>
<li> There is an error in the positioning of a dataset
<li> You wish to account for differences in observation times
</ul>
To shift data spatially, move to the associated icon in the graphic window,
use the <b>left</b> mouse button and select <tt>Spatial offsets</tt> from
the menu.  The result is this widget:
<blockquote><img src=offsets.gif></blockquote>
The first line of the widget:
<blockquote><img src=offenable.gif></blockquote>
provides overall control on spatial offsets.  As long as it is set to
<tt>disabled</tt>, no offsets will be performed.  Click on the button to
enable offsets.
<p>
There are two different offset mechanisms available in horizontal plots.
The first is a constant offset, and is controlled by the next two lines:
<blockquote><img src=offconst.gif></blockquote>
Enter a non-zero value in either blank to force a constant offset in the
given direction.
<p>
To account for advection, a time-based offset may be used, as controlled by
the next three lines:
<blockquote><img src=offadvect.gif></blockquote>
The button at the top is used to allow or disallow advection; no time-based
offsets will be performed if it is set to <tt>disabled</tt>.  The next two
lines are used to set the speed and direction of motion.  When the overlay
is plotted, it will be moved according to the difference between the
observation time and the plot time.  Each sample of the data is offset
individually; thus the shape of an aircraft track will change.
<p>
A couple of other details about spatial offsets:
<ul>
<li> When an overlay has been shifted, the text <tt>SHIFTED</tt> will
     appear in the top annotation for that overlay.
<li> If both constant and time-based offsets are specified, their effect is
     additive.
</ul>
