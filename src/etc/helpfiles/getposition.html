<title>Retrieving Coordinates from Horizontal Plots</title>
<h1>Retrieving Coordinates from Horizontal Plots</h1>

The <b>Position Widget</b> allows the user to click on a point in a 
<a href=horizontal-plots.html>horizontal
plot</a> and see the location of that point.  It reports positions in latitude
and longitude coordinates, as well as in coordinates relative to a chosen
origin.  Relative coordinates are reported as azimuth and range (in
kilometers or nautical miles) and as x and y coordinates on
a rectangular, kilometer grid.

<h3>Popping it up</h3>

Pop up the position widget one of two ways:

<ul>
<li>Find the <img src=z-icon.gif> icon in the lower left corner
of the graphics window.  Choose the
"Popup position readout widget" entry from the icon menu. <p>

<li>Or type 'g' (for 'get position') inside the graphics window.
</ul>

The Position widget looks like this:<p>
<blockquote><img src=position.gif></blockquote>
</p>

<p>The title appears at the top, and the position readout window is just
below the title.  The position readout window reports all of the
coordinates.  The buttons and text windows below the position readout set
the origin for the relative coordinates and adjust the units of the
coordinates.</p>

<h3>Selecting the point</h3>

<p>Until a point is selected on the horizontal plot, the position readout 
window remains blank.  Move the mouse pointer to the desired location 
in the plot 
and click the <b>left button</b>.  The position widget will display the
latitude and longitude of the selected location.</p>
<blockquote>
<img src=position-ll.gif>
</blockquote>

<p>
The latitude and longitude can be displayed in either decimal degrees or
in degrees, minutes, and seconds.  The current format is shown in 
the button below the position readout window, on the left side of the widget:
either 'Deg/Min/Sec' <img src=position-dms.gif> or 'Decimal Deg' <img
src=position-dd.gif>.  Click on this button to change the display format.
</p>

<p> You can click the left mouse button in the graphics window
at any time and any number of times.  Each time a new point is selected,
the position readout window reports the coordinates of the new point.
</p>

<h3>Changing the origin</h3>

When no origin has been chosen for the position widget, the readout
window contains the message 'No origin for relative coordinates'.  No
relative coordinates can be reported until an origin is chosen.  The
name of the origin must be entered in the text window below the position
readout window.  Type the name of the origin
in the text window and press <b>Return</b>.
The example above has set the origin to 'honiara'.</p>

<p> The origin can be chosen from among the locations of the
project configuration.  Most projects have a
location called 'ops-ctr'.  Also, any of the locations available in the
project's <a href=hp-coords.html>overlay</a> menu can also be used as
origins.  The origin name is the station or location label seen in the
horizontal plot.  </p>

<p> The origin can be changed at any time by entering a new name into the
origin window.  If you change the origin name and then press <b>Return</b>
inside the text window, the coordinates of the currently selected point
will be updated relative to the new origin.  If an origin name is typed
into the text window without pressing return, the new origin will not
become active until a position is selected with the left mouse button.
</p>

<p> If you see the message "Unable to locate origin: xxx" in the lower
right message window, then the origin
name could not be found.  Enter a different name in the origin window.
</p>

<h3>Changing the units of relative coordinates</h3>

<p>
Once an origin is chosen, the readout window will contain the relative
coordinates of the selected position.  The azimuth is reported in compass
degrees, while the range units are toggled between nautical miles and
kilometers by clicking on the lower-left button.  The button label shows
the current range units, either 'Nm' <img src=position-nm.gif> or 'km' <img
src=position-km.gif>.  The x coordinate is kilometers north of the origin,
while the y coordinate is kilometers east of the origin.</p>

<h3>Removing the widget</h3>

Remove the position widget by clicking on the dismiss button
<img src=position-dis.gif>
at the top of the widget.
