<title>Saving a display configuration</title>
<h1>Saving a display configuration</h1>

Once you get the display to a state you like, you should save the
configuration so you don't have to do all that work again.
<p>
If your icon bar provides the configuration editing widget:
<blockquote><img src=ec-confedit.gif></blockquote>
Then click on <tt>Save configuration</tt> now.  If your iconbar has a
<tt>Save display window</tt> entry, select that now.  In either case the
following widget will appear:
<blockquote><img src=ec-save.gif></blockquote>
The name for the configuration appears on the top line, and will normally
be the name of the configuration you started with.  If this is a brand new
configuration, you almost certainly want to change this name to avoid a
conflict with the predefined configuration.  If you are modifying an
existing configuration, you may want to leave the name as-is.
<p>
The second line contains the directory into which your configuration will
be saved.  The default value is the directory <tt>.zeb_configs</tt> in your
home directory (which will be created, if necessary).  If you save
configurations into that directory, you will be able to recall them, but
other users will not see them (unless they take additional steps).  You may
edit this line to save the configuration into the project configuration
directory if you have access there; it is usually called <tt>dconfig</tt>
in the project directory.
<p>
If you save a configuration in your <tt>.zeb_configs</tt> directory with
the same name as a configuration in the project directory, the new one will
take precedence for you, and the predefined configuration will no longer be
accessible.  For this reason, it is best to pick new, unique names for your
own configurations.
<p>
When everything is set, click on <tt>Do it</tt> to save the configuration.
