<title>Zebra Introduction</title>
<h2>Welcome to Zebra</h2>

The Zebra software is for integration, display and management of diverse
environmental data sets.  Zebra's primary use is for the superpositioning of
observational data sets (such as those collected by satellite, radar,
mesonet, buoy, ship, and aircraft) and analysis products (such as
model results, dual-Doppler synthesis or algorithm output).  Data may be
overlaid on a variety of display types, including constant altitude planes,
vertical cross-sections, X-Y graphs, Skew-T plots, and time-height (or
depth) profiles.  The fields for dipslay, color tables, contour intervals,
and various other display options are defined using an icon based
user-interface.   This highly flexible system allows scientific
investigators to interactively superposition and highlight diverse data
set; thus aiding data interpretation.<p>

Data handling capabilities permit external analysis programs to be easily
linked with display and data storage processes. The data store accepts
incoming data, stores it on disk, and makes it available to processes which
need it.  An application library is available for data handling.  The
library functions allow data storage, retrieval and queries using a single
applications interface, regardless of the data's source and organization.
