<h2>Time</h2>
<hr>

Zeb can be run in history, real time, or pseudo-real-time modes. History
mode generates a static display for any given time; real-time mode ingest
data and updates displays in real-time; pseudo-real-time mode runs the
system in a playback mode, simulating real-time events which happened in
the past. <p>

The time displayed in the upper-left hand corner of a Zeb display window is
the "reference time".  The reference time is white in real-time mode and
yellow in history mode.  The data in a display window will NOT necessarily
be collected at the reference time.  Zeb searches for the data that is as
close as possible and prior to the reference time.  The actual time of data
collection is determined using the <a href=overlay-time.html> Overlay Time
Widget </a>.  This widget is obtained by typing a "t" in the display
window.  Especially old data may be indicated by an icon which has changed
colors to red.<p>

Real-time mode is used for field project control. Displays automatically
update as new data arrives.  Within a single display configuration some
windows may run in real-time and other in history modes.  <p>

When a graphics window is displaying data from some time in the past,
rather than the most recent data available in real time, the window is in
history mode.  While a graphics window is in history mode, it's plot will
not be updated as new real-time data arrives. <p>

Zeb indicates that a history time has been set (i.e. the graphics window is
in history mode) by changing the color of the date and time in the graphics
window to yellow.  However, similar to real-time mode, the time displayed
in the upper left corner of the display window is not necessarily the time
the data was collected.  Data for the exact history time selected may not
exist, so Zeb searches for the data that is as close as possible to, as
well as prior to, the selected history time.  Especially old data may be
indicated by an icon which has changed colors to red.  Use the <a
href=overlay-time.html> Overlay Times Widget </a> to see the actual data
collection time.  <p>

The history times of graphics windows can set individually or as a group,
depending on the method used.  All of the windows do not need to be set to
the same time; in fact, some windows can be in real-time mode while others
operate in history mode.<p>

See <a href=setting-time.html> Setting a History Time </a> and <a
href=model-time.html> Setting Model Data Valid and Issue Times </a> for
information on selecting history times.<p>
