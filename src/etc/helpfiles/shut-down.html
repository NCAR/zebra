<h2>Shutting Down Zeb</h2> 

To stop Zeb:

src=tools-icon.gif> in the Icon Bar.  Press and hold the left mouse button.
Drag the cursor until the entry "Shut down Zeb system" is highlighted.
Release the mouse button.<p>

The Icon Bar, the graphics windows, and all associated
widgets such as the Time widget, the Hardcopy widget,
and the Movie and Overlay widgets will disappear from
the screen.<p>

If it is not possible to use the Icon Bar, the graphics
display may be stopped by typing the following command at
the display manager prompt:<p>

        DM> exit<p>

<li>In some configurations,
Zeb may require that a second step to be completely shut down.  The second
step is to type "zstop" at any shell prompt. Assuming the Zeb executable
directory is in your path<p>

%zstop<p>

This command stops processes such as the DataStore and
the EventLogger.
