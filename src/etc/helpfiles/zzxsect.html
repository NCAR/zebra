<title>Zig-zag cross sections</title>
<h1>Zig-zag cross sections</h1>

Zig-zag cross sections take a list of platforms (usually sounding stations)
and generate a vertical cross section along a polyline whose vertices are
the stations.  Only the two stations which bound a segment of the polyline
are used to generate the data for that segment.
<p>
The main control for zig-zag cross sections is the platform selection
widget, which is obtained with the <b>right</b> mouse button on the cross
section <img src=xsect-icon.gif> icon.  The exact appearance of this widget
depends heavily on the configuration your are running, but it will be
something like:
<blockquote><img src=zzxs-sel.gif></blockquote>
To set up a cross section:
<ol>
<li> Usually you will want to clear out the existing set of platforms by
     using the <img src=zzxs-clear.gif> button.  You may also edit the
     existing list in place if you prefer.
<p>
<li> Using the platform buttons, select the group of platforms you wish to
     use in the cross section.  Select them in the order you want them to
     appear in the polyline.
<p>
<li> When you have a set you are happy with, use the <img
     src=zzxs-apply.gif> button to generate the new cross section.
</ol>
<p>
The <b>middle</b> mouse button on the cross section <img
src=xsect-icon.gif> icon may be used to bring up a field selection menu.
