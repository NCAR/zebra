<title>Printing hardcopy</title>
<h1>Printing hardcopy</h1>

Zebra contains a widget to ease the making of monochrome or color prints from
a display window.  To get the hardcopy widget, go to the global <img
src=z-icon.gif> or tools <img src=tools-icon.gif> icon and select
<tt>Print widget</tt>.  Some configurations may have this widget on a
separate printer <img src=print-icon.gif> icon.  In any case, the resulting
widget looks like this:
<blockquote><img src=hcwidget.gif></blockquote>

<h2>Printing options</h2>
<p>
You can control how much of the screen is printed with this line:
<blockquote><img src=hcscreen.gif></blockquote>
The default setting is "one window," meaning that only a single window on
the screen will be printed.  If you click on the button, the widget will
set up to print the entire screen instead.
<p>
The destination of your hardcopy is controlled by:
<blockquote><img src=hcname.gif></blockquote>
Normally you enter in the right-hand blank the name of the printer to which
you wish to print.  If you want to create a file on disk instead, click on
the left button and enter a file name instead.
<p>
The type of printer you have should be set with:
<blockquote><img src=hcdevtype.gif></blockquote>
The default is for a monochrome PostScript printer; you may change that
with the menu attached to the button on the right.
<p>
By default, the output will be printed in "reverse video," meaning that
black and white will be exchanged (no other colors are changed).  This
transformation usually produces better results when printing on white
paper.  You may click on:
<blockquote><img src=hcrevv.gif></blockquote>
to print things exactly as they appear on the screen.
<p>
The final line:
<blockquote><img src=hcremove.gif></blockquote>
controls whether the widget stays on the screen after you make a print.  If
you only want to make one print you may wish to set this to <tt>yes</tt>.

<h2>Actually printing something</h2>

Once you have all the parameters set to your liking, there are some things
to do:
<ol>
<li>	Make sure that the window(s) you wish to print are unobstructed.
	If there are parts of other windows on top, they may appear in your
	output (the actual behavior depends on your system).

<li>	Click on the <img src=hcprint.gif> button.  If you are printing a
	single window, the pointer will change to a crosshair, and you
	should click on the window to be printed.
<p>
<li>	Walk to the printer and collect your output.
</ol>

Clicking on <tt>Dismiss</tt> will get rid of this widget when you are
finished with it.

<! There are several environment variables which should really be covered
somewhere.>
