<h1>Time-series plots</h1>

<p>
Time-series plots display an arbitrary number of fields and platforms
plotted against time on the X axis.

<h2>Working with time-series windows</h2>
When you first add a time-series window to the screen (for details on
adding windows see the <a href=editing-configs.html>editing</a> section),
it comes up empty, like this:
<blockquote><img src=ts-empty.gif></blockquote>
Most people consider this pretty boring, and will want to add some data to
the window.  There are a couple of ways to add data to time-series windows:
<ul>
<li> The most common way is with <a href=posicons.html>active icons</a> in
     a horizontal window.  For example, an array of surface stations can be
     placed on the horizontal window as a station plot, then individual
     stations can be picked and added to the time-series window.
<p>
<li> Some sorts of platforms (i.e. aircraft) may be added directly from the
     <a href=iconbar.html>icon bar</a>.
</ul>
In either case, when a platform is added to an empty time-series window, a
default field (usually temperature) is picked and displayed, yielding
something like:
<blockquote><img src=ts-first.gif></blockquote>
If you wish to see a different field, move to the time-series <img
src=tseries-icon.gif> icon and use the <b>middle</b> mouse button to pull
down the field menu and select a new field.
<p>
If you now add a second platform to the time-series window, a new trace
will be added displaying whatever field is already present in the window:
<blockquote><img src=ts-two.gif></blockquote>
Platforms may be stacked up indefinitely.
<p>
Now suppose you want to look at a second field in this window.  Move back
to the time-series <img src=tseries-icon.gif> icon and use the <b>right</b>
mouse button to select <tt>Add new field</tt> from the bottom of the menu.
The window will add a new field and axis, making an attempt to (1) pick a
field which does not already appear in the window, and (2) assign unique
colors to the new traces for each platform.  This attempt is not always
entirely successful, but it is a start.  The result will look something
like:
<blockquote><img src=ts-split.gif></blockquote>
A few details of interest when adding fields:
<ul>
<li> A new axis will be added for the new field, even if some fields could
     share an axis (i.e. temperature and dewpoint).  If autoscaling is on
     (the default) the axes will be different; you will need to use manual
     scaling to force the two fields to a common axis.
<p>
<li> You can add as many fields as you wish, but it really gets kind of
     messy after two.  It is possible to set up time-series windows that
     deal gracefully with more axes, but some knowledge of zebra
     configuration is required.
<p>
<li> Space for side annotation often gets tight as more fields and
     platforms are added.  In the above picture I have used the
     <b>right</b> mouse button on the time-series icon to remove the times
     from the side annotation to make more space.
</ul>

<h2>Removing data from time-series plots</h2>

There are a couple different ways to remove data from time-series plots,
depending on what you wish to accomplish:
<p>
If you want to get rid of all traces for a given field, move to the
associated time-series <img src=tseries-icon.gif> icon and select
<tt>remove</tt> with the <b>left</b> mouse button in the usual manner.
<p>
If you want to remove individual traces, you need to move instead to that
trace's annotation on the right side of the window.  The line to the right
of the platform name will illuminate:
<blockquote><img src=ts-sannot.gif></blockquote>
You may then use the <b>left</b> mouse button to remove the given trace.
If you remove all traces for a field, the entire field will be removed from
the window.

<h2>Other time-series features</h2>

If you use the <b>left</b> mouse button on the time-series <img
src=tseries-icon.gif> icon to select <tt>adjust limits</tt>, you will get a
widget like the following:
<blockquote><img src=ts-limits.gif></blockquote>
This widget allows a couple of operations:
<ul>
<li> The time period covered by the plot may be changed.  Note that this is
     a global parameter, even though you accessed it via an individual
     overlay.  If you change the time period, it will be changed for all
     fields in the window.
<p>
<li> You may change scale modes and limits.  Time-series plots use
     autoscaling by default, but there are times when that is not
     desireable.  For example, one glitch in the data can completely
     demolish the scaling algorithm, reducing your data to a horizontal
     line.  If you set the scale mode to <tt>manual</tt>, you must also set
     the upper and lower bounds to their desired values.
</ul>
<p>
The colors of individual traces may be changed.  Move into the side
annotation area of the trace you wish to change, and use the <b>right</b>
button menu to select a new color.
<p>
Time-series plots are <a href=zoom.html>zoomable</a>.  Simply use shift
and the left mouse button in the usual manner.
<p>
Finally, time-series plots need not be drawn as lines.  The <b>right</b>
button may be used in the time-series <img src=tseries-icon.gif> icon to
change the representation to one of a number of iconic forms.  (An
experienced configuration hacker can make any icon available; the menu has
a selected subset).  After changing the representation and shortening the
time period, the above plot ends up like:
<blockquote><img src=ts-nolines.gif></blockquote>
