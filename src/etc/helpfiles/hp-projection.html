<title>Map projections</title>
<h1>Map projections</h1>

Zebra has the ability to use several different map projections for
horizontal plots.  This capability is not useful in many situations, but
can be crucial for some projects.
<p>
The default projection, called simply the "Zebra" projection, is an
equidistant cylindrical variety.  This projection has the advantage of
producing fast graphics.  It works quite well in situations where a small
area is being plotted, or where the plot area is in the tropics.
<p>
Several other projections are available, if your version of Zebra has been
built to include them.  Binary distributions from RDP have projections
enabled.  Note, however, that plotting with other projections will be
slower.  Image data (such as satellite imagery) in particular takes longer
to plot.
<p>
The projections currently available are:
<ul>
	<li>Albers equal area.
	<li>Cassini.
	<li>Mercator.
	<li>Equidistant cylindrical.  This projection is identical to the
	     default Zebra projection, but uses the map projection library
	     instead of the (optimized) internal routines.
	<li>Lambert equal area.
	<li>Lambert conformal
	<li>Lambert conformal polar
	<li>Mollweide
	<li>Orthographic
</ul>
To change the map projection, move to the top annotation area of the window
of interest.  The current projection will be annotated there, immediately
next to the date.  This area will highlight as you move the pointer into
it; by pressing the <b>left</b> mouse button, you will obtain a menu which
allows you to change projections.
