<h1>Adding data to horizontal plots</h1>

The ability to overlay data is fundamental to zeb, and no more so than in
the horizontal plot format.  The mechanism for overlaying data is quite
simple.

<h2>Adding data</h2>

Recall that all zeb configurations include an iconbar:
<p><img src=iconbar.gif><p>
Most of the icons in the iconbar correspond to available sources of data.
If you were interested in, say, an aircraft track, the sequence of steps to
display that track in a horizontal window would be:
<ol>
<li> Move to the aircraft <img src=aircraft.gif> icon in the icon bar.
<li> Pull down the menu and pick the aircraft that interests you.
<li> When the pointer changes to the crosshair shape, click on the window
     where you wish to see the track.
</ol>
The window will then redraw with the new data incorporated.  If you
mistakenly select a data source that you do not wish to plot, clicking on
the background (instead of on a graphic window) will cancel the operation.

<h2>Removing data</h2>

To remove a data overlay from a horizontal plot, simply move to the
associated icon in the graphic window, pull down the menu with the left
button, and select <tt>remove</tt>.  See also <a
