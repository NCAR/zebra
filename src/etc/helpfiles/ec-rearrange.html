<h1>Rearranging windows on the screen</h1>

The next step is to fix up all the windows on the screen until they are the
way you want them to be.  All Zebra graphic windows can be moved around with
your window manager's usual <b>move</b> and <b>resize</b> operations.
Systems and window managers vary widely, and there is no way to cover them
all here, so you are on your own for this step.
<p>
You may also move and resize the icon bar.  <b>Note</b> however that there
is currently a bug in the MIT Athena box widget that can cause an infinite
loop on occasion when the icon bar is resized too small.  Be sure to keep
it large enough to hold all of the icons and this problem will not occur.
<p>
The other aspect of setting up the display is to get the contents of the
windows to be what you want.  The bulk of this help volume describes the
ways to get data into graphic windows, so that will not be covered here.
