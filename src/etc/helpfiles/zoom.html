<title>Zooming</title>
<h2>Zooming a Graphics Window</h2>
<hr>
Zeb allows you to easily zoom the window in to an area of interest.  The
steps for "zooming" are;
<ol>
<li> With the mouse, move the pointer to one corner of the area of
     interest.
<li> Hold down the <tt>shift</tt> key, then press <b>and hold</b> the left
     mouse button.  Zeb will draw a box that looks like:
     <blockquote><img src=zoombox.gif></blockquote>
<li> Use the mouse to drag the corner of the box until the box contains the
     area of interest.
<li> Release the mouse button.
</ol>
The <tt>shift</tt> key is necessary because users found that, otherwise, it
was too easy to accidentally zoom up to a very small part of the display.
If you find yourself unwillingly zooming anyway, simply press a second
mouse button before releasing the first to cancel the zoom.
<p>
All previous zooms are saved when you zoom up.  You may zoom several times
in succession; to return to a previous zoom just press the "<tt>b</tt>" key
in the display window.  (<b>Note:</b> some window managers may require a
mouse click in the window before you may type at it).
<p>
An alternative for unzooming is to use the menus.  Move the mouse to the
<img src=zeb-icon.gif> icon in the display window (<b>not</b> the one
in the iconbar) and use the <b>left</b> mouse button to obtain the menu.
Select <tt>Scale back to the big picture</tt>.
