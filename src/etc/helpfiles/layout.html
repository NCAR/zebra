<title>Adjusting the Layout</title>
<h1>Adjusting the Layout</h1>

<p>A graphics window divides the plot into several regions.  The most obvious
region is the area which contains the plot of the data themselves.  Other
regions include the top and side (legend) annotation regions, and the icon
region across the bottom of the window.  The top annotation typically
contains the time of the window, whether in history or real-time mode, the
platforms being plotted, and the representations of those platforms, such
as contour or raster, track or stations.  The side annotation contains
legends for the components of the plot, such as wind vector scales, color
bars, keys to station quadrants, labels for time series traces, and so on.
Lastly, the icons at the bottom left corner of the window all reside in the
icon region.</p>

<p>In addition to the icon and annotation areas, the data area is
surrounded by four rectangles called axis regions: top, bottom, left, and
right.  These regions provide space for xy-plot axes, horizontal grid
labels, or buffers between the plot overlays and the borders of the
window.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows the layout of a graphics window.</p>

<p><img src=layout.gif></p>

<p>Each of the plot regions, except for the data region, is controlled by a
single plot parameter.  One dimension of the region is always fixed, while
the other can vary to suit the needs of the particular plot.  For example,
the icon region always consumes the entire width of the window, but the
height can be changed.  Likewise, the height of the legend region always
covers the distance between the top of the icon region and the bottom of
the top annotation, but the width of the legend space can be changed.  Once
the sizes of all of the regions have been set, the data region takes all of
the space left over in the middle of the window.</p>

<p>The layout parameters hold two types of values, fixed or fractional.
Fixed values specify an exact number of pixels for the variable dimension
of a region, while fractional values indicate the size of the region as a
fraction of that dimension of the window.  For example, the legend space
defaults to 15% of the width of the window.  The top annotation defaults to
10% of the window height, while the icon space defaults to 50 pixels.  The
icon space remains 50 pixels high regardless of how the window is resized,
while the legend and annotation areas will change in proportion to the size
of the window.  A space parameter of zero disables the region.</P>

<p>In some project configurations, the global icon <img src=z-icon.gif>
in the lower left corner has a menu attached to the middle button which
controls the layout parameters.  The menu contains submenu entries for each
of the window regions.  Drag the mouse to the right to open one of the
parameter submenus, then select a value for that layout parameter.  All of
the parameter menus offer a similar set of values, both fixed and
fractional.  Spaces can be changed from 2.5% to 30%, or from 20 pixels to
160 pixels.  The <em>None</em> option sets the space parameter to zero,
which effectively removes that region from the plot.</p>

<h2>Horizontal Layouts</h2>

<p>In <a href=horizontal-plots.html>horizontal plots</a>, the default
layout will almost always suffice.  Usually the left and right axes are
wide enough to put some aesthetic space around the left and right sides of
the data region.  The left and bottom axes should also be large enough to
hold the labels for horizontal and vertical grid lines.  The top annotation
just provides a default space of 10% of the window height.  If the size of
the top annotation <em>font</em> (see the right-button menu of the global
icon) is decreased or increased, the annotation region <em>height</em> can
be adjusted to accomodate the need for more or less space.</p>

<p>To really maximize the space available for data, the side and top
annotation regions can be set to <em>None</em>.  Neither will be drawn on
the window, leaving the rest of the window space available for plots.  Note
that the <a href=graphics-icons.html>icons</a> will always be drawn, even
if the icon space parameter is zero, since the window cannot be controlled
without the icon menus.</P>

<h2>Skew-t Layouts</h2>

<p><a href=skewt.html>Skew-t plots</a> are very specialized and can often
benefit from customized layout parameters.  A skew-t plot does not use the
usual legend space at all, so the side annotation region can be disabled to
allow more space for the skew-t graph and wind vector profiles.  Some
project configurations will turn off the legend space on skew-t plots by
default.</p>


<h2>XY-Plot Layouts</h2>

<p><a href=xy-graphs.html>XY Graphs</a> naturally make the most use of the
axis regions.  As platforms and traces are added to an xy plot, the event
logger may sometimes report warnings about insufficient space in one or
more of the axis regions.  In this case the layout menu can be used to
increase the space for the particular axes.</p>

<p>Sometimes the side annotation is not wide enough to hold all of the
legend for each of the traces, particularly when the platform or field
names are very long.  In this case the legend space can be widened to make
room for the longer labels.</p>
