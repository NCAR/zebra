<title>Setting History Time</title>
<h1>Setting History Time</h1>

When a graphics window is displaying data from some time in the past,
rather than the most recent data available in real time, the window is in
"history" mode.  The time of the graphics window plot is the "history
time".  While a graphics window is in history mode, it's plot will not be
updated as new real-time data arrives.  When a graphics window is waiting
on the arrival of new data and updating itself as the data arrives, the
graphics window is in "real-time mode".<p>

There are four widgets/menus used to set a history time in Zeb: the <b>
System Time Widget</b>, the <b>Data Available</b> menu entry, the <a
href=movies.html> Movie Controller Widget</a>, and the <a href=model-time.html> Model data widget</a>.  This Section describes the Time
Widget and the Data Available menu. <p>


<h2>Using the system time widget</h2>

The Time Widget allows convenient control of the mode and
time of all of the graphics windows in a display, either
simultaneously or individually.
The widget is obtained from pull-down menu entry <b> Time Widget </b> under
the <img src=zeb-icon.gif> or <img src=tools-icon.gif> icons on the <a
href=iconbar.html>IconBar</a>.  The widget is displayed below. <p>

The Time Widget can be separated into five sections:<p>

<img src=time-widget-window.gif> 
Window control,<p>

<img src=time-widget-date.gif> <br>
Setting the date and time, <p>

<img src=time-widget-mode.gif> 
Setting the mode, <p>

<img src=time-widget-skip.gif> 
Skipping by some interval, <p>

<img src=time-widget-hot.gif> <br>
and Choosing from and Adding to a customized menu of times. <p>

<h3> Window Control</h3>
<img src=time-widget-window.gif> <p>

This section of the Time Widget consists of a single button.  Clicking on
the button pops down a menu of the sets of windows which can be controlled
simultaneously.  The first option in the menu is always "All Windows".  If
"All Windows" is selected from the menu, then the actions performed in the
Time Widget will affect all of the graphics windows simultaneously.  Each
of the rest of the menu options are the name of a currently active graphics
window.  If one of the window names is selected, then that individual
window will be affected by each action performed in the Time Widget, and
that window only.  </p>

<h3> Setting Date and Time </h3>

<img src=time-widget-date.gif> <p>

This section of the widget contains arrow buttons and a text window which
displays a date and time.  This date and time can be modified by either
clicking on the arrow buttons or by typing in the text window.  Changes in
the date and time in this section of the Time Widget do NOT take effect
until the user sets the <b>history mode</b> and time described in the next
paragraph.  If you choose to type the time into the text window, you can
just press <b>Return</b> to set the time as the new history time.  If the
time in the text window cannot be understood, a message will appear in the
label window in the bottom left corner of the time control window.</p>

<h3> Setting Mode </h3>
<img src=time-widget-mode.gif> <p>

This section of the Time Widget contains two buttons: one labeled <b>Real
Time</b> and the other labelled <b>Set Time</b>.  Clicking on the <b>Set
Time</b> button directs that the date and time entered in the Time Widget
be used as the new history time.  If the scope of window control is a
single window (one window name in the window control box), then only that
window's time will change.  If the scope of control is all windows, every
graphics window will be set to the new history time, and each window
automatically enters history mode.  To return the window(s) to real-time
mode, click on the <b>Real Time</b> button.</p>

<h3> Skipping </h3>
<img src=time-widget-skip.gif> <p>

While the system is in history mode, the history time can be 'skipped'
either forward or backward a preset amount of time.  This is done by
entering the desired time interval in the "Skipping" section of the Time
Widget.  First, choose the units for the time interval from the units menu,
either seconds, minutes, hours, or days.  Next, enter the desired skip
interval in the text window left of the units menu.  Finally, click on
either the left or right arrow to move backward or forward in time by the
specified interval.  Once the time interval has been set, the left and
right arrow buttons can be pressed as often as needed.  If the scope of
control is all windows, every window will be set to the new history time as
the time is incremented or decremented.  Otherwise, only the time of the
currently selected window will change.</p>

<h3> Customizing the Menu of Times </h3>
<img src=time-widget-hot.gif>

<p> The time control tool contains a customizable menu of times and
descriptions.  Any time can be remembered and associated with a label.
Once a time has been chosen using one of the methods above, type a
description or title for the particular period in the label window. <img
src=time-widget-hotlabel.gif> To actually add the time to the menu, hit the
<b>Return</b> key in the label window or press the <b>Remember</b> button.
</p>

<p> Any times added to the menu will appear in the popdown menu under the
<b>Select</b> button.  Selecting a time from this menu is similar to manually
entering a time and then pressing <b>Set Time</b>.  The time label will change
to the description associated with the selected time, and the selected time
becomes the current history time.  The windows currently under control will
change to history mode at the selected time.</p>

<p>At the furthest right, the <b>Forget</b> button pops down the menu of
times and will delete whichever time is selected.  The current time and the
last description appearing in the time label will not change, so
accidentally deleting a time can often be undone by pressing
<b>Remember</b> immediately following the delete.</p>

<p>Some project configurations save the customized times into a file so
that the menu persists between different sessions of Zebra.  For those
configurations that do not save the times, the menu will be empty at the
start of each new session.</p>

<h3> Visited Times </h3>

<p> As different times are selected and visited, the time widget
automatically includes the five most recently visited times in the times
menu.  Each of these five times is numbered on the times menu in order from
most recently to least recently visited.  The history time last visited is
always included in the times menu with a number '1' to the left of the
label, while the least recently visited will show a number '5'.  Whenever a
visited time is added automatically where there was no menu entry
previously, the time label is left blank.  The visited times can be removed
(forgotten) from the times menu just like the customized entries. </p>

<h3> Quitting</h3>

<p>
To remove the time widget from the display,
click the <b> Dismiss </b> button to the immediate right of the
<b>Help</b> button at the top of the widget.  The Time Widget
can be popped up again at any time using the steps
described above.</p>


<h2>Using a data available menu</h2>

A Data Available menu may be used to change the mode and history time of a
single graphics window according to the times for which data is available
from a specific platform.  A Data Available menu may be activated by
clicking one of the mouse buttons, typically the right mouse button, on one
of the icons in a graphics window.  Data available menus are only used for
data that are collected at uneven intervals.  The menu consists of entries
containing a platform name followed by a time, as well as one menu entry
for returning to real time mode.  By selecting an entry in this menu, the
graphics window enters history mode with a history time equal to the data
time chosen from the menu.  When the plot changes to its new time, the data
associated with the selected time will be displayed.<p>

Select the "Real time" entry from a Data Available menu to
return the graphics window to real time mode.<p>
