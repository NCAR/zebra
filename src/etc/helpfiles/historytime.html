<title>Setting History Time</title>
<h1>Setting History Time</h1>

When a graphics window is displaying data from some time in the past,
rather than the most recent data available in real time, the window is in
"history" mode.  The time of the graphics window plot is the "history
time".  While a graphics window is in history mode, it's plot will not be
updated as new real-time data arrives.  When a graphics window is waiting
on the arrival of new data and updating itself as the data arrives, the
graphics window is in "real-time mode".<p>

There are four widgets/menus used to set a history time in Zeb: the <b>
System Time Widget</b>, the <b>Data Available</b> menu entry, the <a
href=movies.html> Movie Controller Widget</a>, and the <a href=model-time.html> Model data widget</a>.  This Section describes the Time
Widget and the Data Available menu. <p>


<h2>Using the system time widget</h2>

The Time Widget allows convenient control of the mode and
time of all of the graphics windows in a display, either
simultaneously or individually.
The widget is obtained from pull-down menu entry <b> Time Widget </b> under
the <img src=zeb-icon.gif> or <img src=tools-icon.gif> icons on the <a
href=iconbar.html>IconBar</a>.  The widget is displayed below. <p>

The Time Widget can be separated into four sections:<p>

<img src=time-widget-window.gif> 
Window control,<p>

<img src=time-widget-date.gif> <br>
Setting the date and time, <p>

<img src=time-widget-mode.gif> 
Setting the mode, <p>

<img src=time-widget-skip.gif> 
and Skipping. <p>

<h3> Window Control</h3>
<img src=time-widget-window.gif> <p>

This section of the Time Widget consists of a single button.  Clicking on
the button toggles control between either "All" windows associated with the
display or "One" window.  If "All" is selected, then the actions performed
in the Time Widget will affect all of the graphics windows simultaneously.
If "One" is selected, then an individual window must be chosen as the
target for each action performed in the Time Widget.  When a graphics
window needs to be selected, the cursor will transform into a cross-hair
symbol.  Simply move the cursor to the window you wish to affect and click
the left mouse button.<p>

<h3> Setting Date and Time </h3>

<img src=time-widget-date.gif> <p>

This section of the widget contains arrow buttons and a text window which
displays a date and time.  This date and time can be modified by either
clicking on the arrow buttons or by typing in the text window.  Changes in
the date and time in this section of the Time Widget do NOT take effect
until the user sets the <b>history mode</b> and time described in the next
paragraph.<p>

<h3> Setting Mode </h3>
<img src=time-widget-mode.gif> <p>

This section of the Time Widget contains two buttons.  One labeled <b>Real
Time</b> and the other labelled <b>History</b>.  Clicking on the
<b>History</b> button directs that the date and time entered in the Time
Widget be used as the new history time.  If the scope of the time change is
a single window (window control is "One"), the window must be clicked with
the cursor as described above.  If the scope of control is "All" windows,
every graphics window will be set to the new history time.  This
automatically puts each of those windows in history mode.  To return the
window(s) to real-time mode, click on the <b>Real Time</b> button.<p>

<h3> Skipping </h3>
<img src=time-widget-skip.gif> <p>

While the system is in history mode, the history
time can be 'skipped' either forward or backward a preset
number of minutes.  This is done by entering the desired
number of minutes in the text window within the "Skipping"
section of the Time Widget.  Enter the desired skip
interval, then click on either the left or right arrow to
move backward or forward that number of minutes in time. 
If the scope of control is "All", every window will be set
to the new history time as the time is incremented or
decremented.  Otherwise a single window must be selected as
the target for each time change.<p>

<h3> Quitting</h3>

To remove the time widget from the display,
click the <b> Dismiss </b> button to the immediate right of the
<b>Help</b> button at the top of the widget.  The Time Widget
can be popped up again at any time using the steps
described above.<p>


<h2>Using a data available menu</h2>

A Data Available menu may be used to change the mode and history time of a
single graphics window according to the times for which data is available
from a specific platform.  A Data Available menu may be activated by
clicking one of the mouse buttons, typically the right mouse button, on one
of the icons in a graphics window.  Data available menus are only used for
data that are collected at uneven intervals.  The menu consists of entries
containing a platform name followed by a time, as well as one menu entry
for returning to real time mode.  By selecting an entry in this menu, the
graphics window enters history mode with a history time equal to the data
time chosen from the menu.  When the plot changes to its new time, the data
associated with the selected time will be displayed.<p>

Select the "Real time" entry from a Data Available menu to
return the graphics window to real time mode.<p>
