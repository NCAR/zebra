<title> EDITING DISPLAY CONFIGURATIONS </title>
<h1> Editing Display Configurations</h1>

This topic describes the process of editing a display configuration.  New
configurations can be created or existing configurations can be modified to
personal preference.  First, change to the display configuration which will
be modified.  To start a new configuration from scratch, change to the
<b>Empty</b> configuration.  See the help topic "Changing Display
Configurations" for details on setting the display configuration.
<p>
Next, popup the "Configuration Editing" widget from the <img
src=zeb-icon.gif> on the Icon Bar.   A widget will appear containing six
buttons. In newer version of Zeb the Configuration Editing widget has been
replaced with t
<p>
The <tt>Cancel</tt> button, as always, removes the widget from the
screen.  All of the configuration pop-up widgets will have a <Cancel>
button; press this button to remove the widget without performing any
actions.  The <tt>Help</tt> button pops up this help topic.  The rest of the
buttons function as described in the following paragraphs.  Essentially
there are four options: create a new configuration by copying an existing
one, add a window to the current configuration, delete a window from the
current configuration, or save the current configuration under a specified
name in specified directories.  After adding, deleting, moving, and/or
resizing windows in a new or existing configuration, and after configuring
the plots in each window as desired, the entire display configuration can
be saved for future reference through the "Save Configuration" mechanism
described at the end of this topic.


<h2>CLONING A CONFIGURATION</h2>

The <tt>New Configuration</tt> button pops up a window for creating a new
configuration by 'cloning' an existing configuration.  Two names must be
specified in the popped-up window: the name of the configuration to create
and the name of the configuration to clone.  Note that the configuration
being cloned need not be the configuration which is currently displayed.
However, the default clone name will always be taken as the name of the
current configuration.  Once both names have been specified, press the
<tt>Create Configuration</tt> button.  The new configuration will be
created and automatically installed as the current display configuration.


<h2>ADDING A NEW WINDOW</h2>

The <tt>New Window</tt> button pops up a widget for adding a new window to
the current display configuration.  Several parameters may be set through
this widget.  The "New window name:" field will be the name of the new
window.  This name must be unique among the other windows in the
configuration.  The window must also be assigned a plot description.  The
plot description name can be typed directly, inside the "Plot description:"
text window, or it can be chosen from the pull-down menu under the
<tt>Select Plot Description</tt> button.  The window also needs a button
map, specified in the "Button map:" text window or through the pull-down
menu <tt>Select Button Map</tt>.  The default plot description is "template",
while the default button map is "default".  For horizontal plots, the "big"
button map is the most commonly used map.  The choice of plot description
will depend principally on the type of plot desired, such as "Mesonet" for
a horizontal plot with surface data, "Skew-t" for a skew-t plot, "Time
Series" for a time-series plot, or "Cross-Sect" for a cross-section plot.
Once the new window is created with the basic plot type configured, new
combinations of platforms and overlays can be configured through the normal
icon menus.
<p>
The last parameter for the new window is "PD Force?"  This parameter can be
toggled between "yes" and "no".  If "yes", a new plot description will
always be forced onto the window, even if the window already exists.
Otherwise a window which already exists will keep its current plot
description.
<p>
Display configurations typically share window names so that new windows
need not be created for every configuration change.  For example, the
"Radar" configuration uses four windows named "UpperLeft", "UpperRight",
"LowerLeft", and "LowerRight".  In the "Radar" configuration, the window
"UpperLeft" is a skew-t plot, whereas in the "Surface Data" configuration,
"UpperLeft" is a horizontal plot.  Another possible naming scheme, however,
might include a window named "CrossSection" which is present in most
display configurations and is always a cross-section plot.  Hence the
necessity of the "Force PD" parameter.  When changing to a configuration
which uses a window whose name is used in the present configuration, the
new plot description must replace the current one in order for the correct
plot-type and platform overlays to be installed in the window.
<p>
Once all of the parameters have been set as desired, press the <tt>Create
Window</tt> button to actually create the new window.  After the window
appears, use the window manager to move and resize the window to the
desired geometry.  Use the Icon Bar and graphics window icons to add,
remove, and configure the platform plots in the window.


<h2>DELETING A WINDOW</h2>

The <tt>Delete Window</tt> button pops up a window selection widget.  The
window to be deleted must be specified by name.  The name can be entered in
the text window next to "Window name:" or by selecting the window with the
mouse.  Mouse selection is only possible if the window is visible on the
screen.  To use the mouse, press the <tt>Select with mouse</tt> button.
When the cursor becomes a cross-hair, click the mouse inside the window you
wish to delete.  The name of the selected window will be entered as the
"Window name:".  If the selected window was not a valid choice, "none" will
appear in the text window.  Once the window name has been specified, press
the <tt>Do it</tt> button to delete the window.


<h2>SAVING A CONFIGURATION</h2>

The <tt>Save Configuration</tt> button of the "Configuration Editing" widget
allows the current configuration to be saved to disk so that it can be
recalled on later invocations of Zeb.  Press the <tt>Save Configuration</tt>
button to pop-up the "Save Configuration" widget.  In the top text window,
specify a name for the configuration.  The "Config directory:" text window
specifies where the display configuration files will be stored, while "PD
directory:" specifies where the plot descriptions for all of the windows
will be stored.  Ordinarily neither of the directory paths will need to
change.
<p>
To actually save the configuration, press the <Do It> button.  The entire
state of the current Zeb display, including the locations and plot
descriptions of all of the graphics windows, will be written to disk under
the given name.  The configuration may be displayed by entering the
following command at the display manager prompt:

<pre>
DM> pconfig <config-name>
</pre>

The configuration can be added to the Icon Bar <tt>Zeb</tt> menu by editing the
file 'IconBar' in the <tt>project</tt> directory.
