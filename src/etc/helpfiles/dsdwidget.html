<h1>The data store display widget</h1>

The data store display widget may be used to query the data which is
currently held in the zeb data store.  To get this widget, move to the
global <img src=zeb-icon.gif> or tools <img src=tools-icon.gif> icon in the
icon bar and select <tt>Data store display widget</tt> from the menu.  The
result will be a widget like:
<blockquote><img src=dsdwidget.gif></blockquote>

Note that there is usually a delay before the widget appears; if you have a
very large data store, this delay can be up to a few minutes.
<p>
Each line in the data store display widget describes one platform and the
time period covered by the data for that platform.  You will almost
certainly need to use the scrollbar on the left to view all the platforms.
<p>
To examine a single platform in more depth, simply click on the line for
that platform.  You will get a new widget that looks like:
<p><img src=dsdfiles.gif><p>
This widget lists each data file which exists for the platform and the time
period covered.  The data store widget is currently limited in that it can
display the files widget for only one platform at a time; if you wish to
examine a different platform you should click on the "done" button to
dismiss the existing files widget.
<p>
In real time situations, you can ask the display widget to check for any
new data by clicking on the "<tt>New data?</tt>" button.  The widget will
not automatically track incoming data.
