<title>Interpolation methods</title>
<h1>Adjusting interpolation</h1>

Certain types of plots (i.e. contours and wind fields) may need to
interpolate irregularly-spaced data prior to display.  Such overlays will
have an <tt>adjust interpolation</tt> option on the right-button icon menu.
This option produces a widget like:

<blockquote><img src=interpparams.gif></blockquote>

The basic type of interpolation performed is controlled through the
<tt>Interpolation method</tt> menu.  The options available vary, depending
on the type of plot you are using.
<p>
For Constant Altitude (CAP) Plots, there are three possible types of
interpolation:
<ul>
<li><tt>Barnes</tt>:  Applies a Barnes objective analysis.
<li><tt>Closest-point</tt>: Performs a simple, closest-point
	interpolation.
<li><tt>Rgrid</tt>:  Applies the rgrid (triangulation) method.  Rgrid is
	provided mostly for backward compatibility, and its use is not
	recommended.
</ul>
<p>
XYGraph plots (such as time-height plots) have two options:
<ul>
<li><tt>Profile-linear</tt>: Performs a linear interpolation across the
	rows of the destination grid.  No vertical interpolation is done.
	This method is intended for use with time-height plots.
<li><tt>Closest-point</tt>:  Performs a simple closest-point interpolation.
</ul>

The resolution of the destination grid may be controlled by setting the
appropriate values in the widget.  The defaults (usually 25 by 25) are
usually adequate.  Note, however, that for profile-linear interpolation,
the vertical resolution will be decreased as necessary to avoid exceeding
that of the data.
<p>
The <b>radius of influence</b> value is relevant to Barnes interpolation
only, and controls how quickly the influence of a data point fades at more
distant grid points.  The influence of a data point is one-tenth its full
value at a grid point that is exactly the <tt>radius</tt> grid points away.
<p>
The <b>max fill</b> also applies only to Barnes interpolation, and
controls how far a grid point may be from a good data value before being
set to the bad value flag.
<p>
When you have adjusted the interpolation parameters, click on <b>Apply</b>
to apply them to the display window.  Otherwise you may simply use
<b>Dismiss</b> to get rid of the widget without changing anything.
