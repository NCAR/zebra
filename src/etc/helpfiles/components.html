<h2>The Pieces of the Zeb Display</h2>
<hr>
Generally when Zeb is running, three types of displays are visible on the
workstation. They are the <a href=event-logger.html>Event Logger</a>, <a
href=iconbar.html>IconBar </a>, and one or more <a href=graphic-windows.html>
Graphics Window </a>.<p>

The arrangement and content of these windows is called a "display
configuration". Display configurations allow all of the possible
combinations of windows in a Zeb graphics display to be easily managed. A
display configuration includes the locations and sizes of the Icon Bar
window, all of the graphics windows, and occasionally the Event Logger
window.  In addition, it includes the plot descriptions in use by each
graphics window, so that the data and representations and plotting
parameters of a plot can be precisely re-created at any time.  By allowing
display components to be managed as groups, i.e. as whole display
configurations, the Zeb display can quickly and easily alternate between
different personal preferences and different analysis applications.  See
the topics <a href default-configs.html> Changing the Display
Configuration</a> and <a href editing-configs.html> Editing Display
Configurations </a> for additional information.
