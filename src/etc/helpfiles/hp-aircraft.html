<title>Adjusting track parameters</title>
<h1>Adjusting track parameters</h1>

Tracks show the position of a moving platform (such as an aircraft, boat,
or balloon) over a period of time, possibly annotated, color-coded, and
with wind arrows.  There is a very large number of parameters which control
the plotting of tracks, which will be described here.
<p>
When you pull a track off the icon bar, you will get something that looks
like the following by default:
<blockquote><img src=track.gif></blockquote>
This is a track which is color-coded by the altitude of the aircraft,
covering an hour of flight, with wind arrows and an icon at the end.  The
icon is an active <a href=posicons.html>position icon</a> and may be used
to display this platform in other windows.

<h2>Color coding</h2>
The color-coding of this track is controlled by the menu on the
<b>middle</b> mouse button in the icon at the bottom of the graphics
window.  This (often lengthy) menu lists all of the fields available for
this platform; selecting a field will cause the track to be color-coded
using that field.  The special field <tt>None</tt> at the bottom of the
menu disables color-coding; the result, if selected, will be a monochrome
track.

<h2>Simple track parameters</h2>

The <b>right</b> mouse button in the icon will produce a menu that allows
some simple parameters to be adjusted:
<ul>
<li> The <b>color</b> of the track -- when color coding has been turned
     off, as described above.
<li> The <b>width</b> of the track.  If you need to emphasize a track over
     a busy background, it can be helpful to make it very wide.
</ul>

<h2>Fancy track parameters</h2>

However, many track parameters are accessible only through the <tt>other
track parameters</tt> entry in the right-button menu, which yields this
widget:
<blockquote><img src=acwidget.gif></blockquote>
At the top is the <b>Time period</b> line.  This line controls the length
of the track (in time); it's use is pretty much self-explanitory.
<p>
The next few lines control the placement of wind (or other vector field)
arrows on the track:
<blockquote><img src=acarrows.gif></blockquote>
The top line lets you turn arrows off altogether, or to change their
colors.  The next line down controls the separation (in time) of the
arrows, and their size.  The "scale factor" is an obscure number, and is
best adjusted relative to its current setting without an attempt to
understand it.  The bottom line allows the fields used for the arrows to be
changed.
<p>
The bottom two lines
<blockquote><img src=acannot.gif></blockquote>
control the placement of time annotations on the track.  These annotations
are turned off by default (to reduce clutter), but may be enabled when
precise knowledge of times is required.  The parameters controlling
annotations are all pretty obvious.  The result of enabling annotations
with the parameters shown above is:
<blockquote><img src=track-a.gif></blockquote>
