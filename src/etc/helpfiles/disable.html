<title>Disabling an overlay</title>
<h1>Disabling an overlay</h1>

There are likely to be times when you will wish to remove an overlay from
the display temporarily, in order to better see a different overlay, or
just to speed up display time for a while.  You could do this by simply
removing the overlay, but then any changes you have made to it will
disappear.  A better way is to <b>disable</b> the overlay.
<p>
To disable an overlay, move to the global <img src=zeb-icon.gif> icon in
the display window (not in the icon bar), and pull down the menu with the
<b>left</b> mouse button.  Select <tt>Disable/reenable</tt> and release the
mouse button.
<p>
The display will now redraw without the disabled overlay.  The overlay's
icon will change to a gray color (i.e. an icon like <img
src=iconbar-sat.gif> turns into <img src=iconbar-sat-gray.gif>).  Any
changes you have made to that overlay will be preserved; simply select the
same menu entry again to restore the overlay to the display.
