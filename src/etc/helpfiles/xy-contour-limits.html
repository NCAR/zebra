<title>Adjusting xygraph contour limits</title>
<h1>Adjusting xygraph contour limits</h1>

To change the plotting of contours in an xygraph plot, select <b>adjust
limits</b> from the left icon menu.  The result is a widget like:
<blockquote><img src=xy-contour-limits.gif></blockquote>
Normally, contours are plotted in the <b>autoscale</b> mode, meaning that
contour values are assigned in such a way as to fit the data being plotted
at the time.  There are a number of situations in which you may want to
change this behavior, however, including:
<ul>
<li>	A glitch in the data causes contours to be spread over a much too
	wide area;
<li>	You are generating movies and want to insure that the contour
	values remain the same over time;
<li>	You simply do not like the results produced by the autoscale code.
</ul>
To toggle the scale mode, you need only click on the <b>scale mode</b>
button.
<p>
In manual mode, you will need to specify center and step values for the
contours.  The default values in these two blanks are usually the last
values produced by the autoscale mode, or the the most recent values you
have entered yourself, whichever happened later.  They usually make a good
starting point for your own values.
<p>
Click on <b>apply</b> when you have values you like, or <b>dismiss</b> to
get rid of the widget without changing anything.
