<h1>Widgets</h1>

<p>Various widgets (windows with information or commands) are an important
part of Zebra.  Many of them are shown in the table below:</p>

When a function requiring a widget is requested from one of the icons, the
widget "pops up". How the widget pops up is dependant on the window manager
that Zebra is running under (a widget is manipulated in the same manner as
other windows in the window manager). If an outline of a box appears, move
the box to a preferred location and click on the left button (left-click).
Widgets generally will not disappear automatically. To remove them click on
Zap, Dismiss or Cancel.
