<title>Overlay Times Widget</title>
<h2>Determining the Time of Data Collection</h2>
<hr>

The Graphics Window plots the latest data available with a
time occurring before the window's plot time, but it does
not show the actual time of the data used for each platform
in the plot.  The Overlay Times widget shows this
information (i.e. it displays the time at which the data was
collected for each data platform represented in the
graphics window).<p>

The widget may be popped up in two ways.  Either select the "Popup overlay
times window" entry from the left-button menu of the <img
src=zeb-icon.gif> (in the lower-left corner of the graphics window), or
type 't' anywhere inside the graphics window.<p>

A sample widget is shown.<p>

<p>

The Overlay Times window will appear containing a list of all of the
platforms being plotted in the graphics window, except for static overlays
like maps, grids, and locations.  Next to each platform name, the widget
displays the field, alititude and time of the data which the graphics
window is presently plotting.  For example, suppose the plot time is
"15-Dec-92,20:00:00".  If GMS satellite data is only sampled at the 45
minutes after the hour, then the Overlay Times widget will display a time
of "15-Dec-92,19:45:00" next to the platform name GMS.  This is the time
for which the satellite image being displayed is valid.  If the 19:45 image
were missing, this information would be reflected in the widget by a GMS
platform time of 18:45.  The times shown in the Overlay Times window will
ALWAYS be correct, even if the graphics window is in movie mode.  The
overlay times will always correspond to the frame currently visible in the
graphics window, even while stepping backward and forward through frames
and while running a movie. <p>

To remove the Overlay Times Widget, click on the <b>Dismiss</b>
button at the top of the widget.<P>
