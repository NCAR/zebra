<h1>Changing Overlay Colors and Labels</h1>

Zeb's user interface facilitates a variety of changes to the display.  Many
of the changes are accomplished through the use of pull-down menus that are
accessed via the mouse sensitive icons.  This section reviews how to change
colors and labels associated with a field.  The user is encouraged to try
the other options that are accessed in the manner described below.

<h2>Changing the color of a simple overlay</h2>

Zeb allows the colors of overlays to be easily changed.  These changes are
generally done through pull down menus associated with <a
href=graphics-icons.html>"field" </a> or <a href=posicon.html>
"position"</a> icons.  Zeb allows the colors or color tables associated with
all fields to be changed. Generally the pull-down menu used to make color
changes is found on the right mouse button but in some cases, it is located
on the middle mouse button or in a seperate widget.  For the purposes of
this explanation, a sounding position overlay will be used.<p> 

Associated with the sounding location overlay is an icon <img
src=sounding-icon.gif> at the bottom of the display window.  This icon provides
access to a couple of menus which will be used to modify the overlay.<p>

Generally when sounding locations are first added to a horizontal graphics
window they are bright green and look like this;<p>

<img src=sounding1.gif>.<p>
If you wish to display the them in a different color:
<ol>
<li> Move the mouse pointer to the <img src=sounding-icon.gif> icon.
<li> Push and hold the <b>right</b> mouse button.  You will see a menu pop
     up:
     <blockquote><img src=menu1.gif></blockquote>
<li> Move to the <b>Color</b> entry, then move the pointer to the right to
     get the color menu:
     <blockquote><img src=menu2.gif></blockquote>
<li> Select the color you wish (red, in the example above), and release the
     mouse button.
</ol>
The window will replot and the boat looks like:<p>
<img src=sounding2.gif><p>

<h2> Changing Labels </h2>

To label the sounding, from the same menu as above select <b>Name
labels</b> and get:<p>

<img src=sounding3.gif><p>
Each ship is now labelled with its name.
<p>
Locations may also be decorated with time labels.  Select <b>Time
labels</b>.  The display now looks like:<p> 
<img src=sounding4.gif><p>
The string on the right-hand side is the time that the most recent sounding
was released.  If the sounding is more than a day old, a date will also be
display.<p>

If you move to the <img src=sounding-icon.gif> icon and push and hold the
<b>left</b> mouse button, you will get a different menu. This menu (or
something very similar to it) appears on every overlay.  Most of the
operations provided are self-explanatory; they provide for changing the
stacking order of overlays or getting rid of them altogether.  The <a
href=limits.html>Adjust limits</a> and <a href=hp-shift.html>Spatial
offset</a> options are described elsewhere.
