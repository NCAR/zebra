<title>Controlling mesonet station density</title>
<h1>Controlling mesonet station density</h1>

In some situations (such as with the first STORM-FEST CDROM), zeb can try
to display a very large number of mesonet stations in a small area on the
screen.  The resulting jumble of arrows and numbers is not much use to
anybody.  In situations like this, zeb offers a filtering capability which
can be used to trim down the amount of data displayed.
<p>
To control filtering, go to the icon in the graphic window for your station
plot, and use the <b>right</b> mouse button to select <tt>spatial
filtering</tt> from the menu.  The result is a widget like:
<blockquote><img src=spfilter.gif></blockquote>
The middle line lets you turn filtering on or off; no filtering will be
performed as long as it is set to <tt>disabled</tt>.  Click on the button
to toggle the state of filtering.
<p>
The bottom line allows you to control the density of stations plotted.  The
number is in <b>screen pixels</b>.  Filtering on a pixel basis allows the
density of stations on the screen to remain constant over several levels of
zooming.  A value of around 50 is usually the smallest which can be used
before the crowding gets bad, but the proper value depends on the data
being plotted and the tastes of the user.  Experiment with it -- that's
what it's for.
