<title>Planar cross sections</title>
<h1>Planar cross sections</h1>

Planar cross sections interpolate data along a single line, usually drawn
interactively.  While it is possible to do planar cross sections of
irregularly-spaced data (i.e. soundings), they are usually only done with
gridded data (model output, gridded radar volumes, etc).
<p>
Configurations containing a planar cross section almost always contain a
horizontal window as well for the control of that cross section.  To
generate a planar cross section, do the following:
<ul>
<li> Move the pointer into the <b>horizontal</b> window, and to where you
     would like one end of the cross section plane to be.
<p>
<li> Push and hold the <b>middle</b> mouse button.  The pointer will move
     slightly, and a line will connect it with its original location.
<p>
<li> Drag the line until it describes the desired cross section plane.
<p>
<li> Release the mouse button.
</ul>
The cross section window will now redraw to reflect the new plane.  The
control window should have a "window bounds" overlay showing the location
of the cross section plane; that, too, will be updated.
<p>
If you change your mind about drawing the plane after locating the first
endpoint, simply push one of the other mouse buttons while holding down the
middle button; the operation will then abort.
