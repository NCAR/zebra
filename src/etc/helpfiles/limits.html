<title>Adjusting display limits</title>
<h1>Adjusting display limits</h1>

You will likely often wish to change the limits used to display a given
overlay.  "Limits" refers to the scaling values used to assign colors,
contour values, and so on.  There is a wide variety of plot types in zeb,
and a correspondingly wide variety of ways to adjust their limits; it is
not possible to discuss them all here.  However, the fundamental concepts
are the same for all of them; some limit adjusters have their own help
entries.
<p>
To adjust the limits for a given overlay, move to that overlay's icon in
the graphic window.  Use the <b>left</b> mouse button to pull down the
menu; the first entry will almost always be <tt>Adjust limits</tt>.  Select
this entry.
<p>
There are two basic types of limit-adjusting widgets; which you get depends
on the configurations you are running and the type of data you are working
with.  The first type will always place itself on the screen (usually above
the icon you just used) and looks like:
<blockquote><img src=adj1.gif></blockquote>
The second type tends to have more options, and may require you to place it
with the mouse:
<blockquote><img src=adj2.gif></blockquote>
With either type of widget, the thing to do is to fill in the new value(s)
in the blanks, then click on the <tt>Apply</tt> or <tt>Store</tt> button.
The window will redraw with the new limits in effect.
<p>
Some types of plots will operate with either manual or automatic scaling.
In this case, you should be sure to set the mode to "manual," or any limits
you enter will have no effect.
