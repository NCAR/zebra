<h2> Movies (Time-Lapse Displays)</h2>
<hr>
Movies are chronological sequences of "time frames"
generated and displayed by the movie controller to create
animation of graphics window plots.  Movies can be run in
each of the graphics windows at any time.  First, you must
popup the movie controller.  You can do this two ways:
<ul>
<li>Find the <img src=zeb-icon.gif> icon in the lower left corner
of the graphics window.  Choose the
"Popup Movie Controller" entry from the icon menu. <p>

<li> Or, type 'm' inside the graphics window.
</ul>

The Movie widget:<p>

<h3> Setting Movie Parameters </h3> 
The movie controller provides four
parameters for adjusting; 
<ul>
<li> the duration of the movie, 
<li> the time of the last frame of the movie, 
<li> the interval between frames, and 
<li> the rate at which the frames are displayed.  
</ul>

The movie controller shown above is set to display a movie that is 300
minutes long with a display every 60 minutes, the ending time (displayed as
<b> now </b> on the movie widget) will be the time in the upper left corner
of the graphics window. The display interva is 10 frames/second.<p>

The movie duration and frame interval are measured in "time units" of
seconds, minutes, hours, or days.  The time units are changed using the
pull-down menu under the <img src=movie-tu.gif> button.<p>

There is a limit to the maximum number of frames in a movie (based on
available memory), therefore, the movie duration must be reduced as the
frequency of the frames increases.<p>

There are two options for entering the ending time for a
movie; 
<ul>

<li> Type in the time using the format "DD-MMM-YYYY,HH:MM" for example <img
src=movie-end.gif>. Note that the year must have four digits.  If the time
is left out, as in "04-mar-1992", or specified as "04-mar-1992,0", "00:00"
is assumed. <p>

<li> Type the word "<b>now</b>".  In this case, the ending time is determined
according to the current mode of the graphics window.  If
the graphics window is in real-time mode, the ending time
will be the current system time.  If the graphics window
is in history mode, the ending time will be the history
time (displayed in yellow at the upper left corner of the
window) of the window.
</ul>

<h3>Running the Movie</h3>

Once the movie parameters are adjusted, begin the movie by
pressing the <img src=movie-run.gif> button.  If
the parameters are all valid, the movie controller will
begin generating each frame of the movie.  If an error
occurs, a message will appear on the <img src=movie-stat.gif> line.<p><p>

After each of the frames has been generated and stored, the
movie will run more quickly and smoothly.  The speed of the
movie will depend upon the <img src=movie-speed.gif> parameter (in this
case the movie will run at 10 frames/second). <p><p>

The movie can be stopped at any time, even while the
controller is generating frames, by pressing the <img src=movie-stop.gif>
button.  This leaves the graphics window in history mode,
with a plot time corresponding to the frame at which the
movie stopped.  The movie can be continued by pressing
<img src=movie-run.gif> again.<p><P>

The scroll bar <img src=movie-stat.gif> at the bottom of the movie
controller provides a convenient method for stepping backward and forward
through the movie frames. The first line gives the status of the movie
subsystem ("stopped").  The second line, allows manual control
of the movie.  With the pointer in the second line, you may:
<ul>
<li> Manually step forward with the <b>right</b> mouse button.
<li> Manually step backword with the <b>left</b> mouse button.
<li> Drag the movie in either direction by pressing and holding the
     <b>center</b> mouse button and moving the mouse from side to side.
</ul>

The <img src=movie-rt.gif> button puts the graphics window in real time
mode, taking the plot time from the current system time and disactivating
the movie controller.  This is useful only in real-time applications.<p>

<h3> Quitting the Movie Contoller </h3>

The movie controller window can be removed by pressing the <img
src=movie-dismiss.gif>.<br> <b> Removing the movie controller leaves the
graphics window in the mode and time last set by the movie
controller.</b><p>
