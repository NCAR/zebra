<title>Changing the altitude in a horizontal plot</title>
<h1>Changing the altitude in a horizontal plot</h1>

Horizontal plots have an altitude associated with them, which is used to
select data (such as three-dimensional grids) which exists at more than one
height.  Altitudes may be expressed in several different units (such as
millibars or km AGL), depending on the data being displayed.
<p>
The altitude of a horizontal plot is adjusted through the use of keystrokes
in the graphic window.  (Note that some window managers may require you to
click in the window before keystrokes will be delivered there).  The keys
relevant to altitude control are:
<ul>
<li> The up and down arrow keys.  These keys will move the altitude up or
     down by one level, with the levels being determined by what is
     available in the source data.

<li> The <tt>PgUp</tt> and <tt>PgDn</tt> keys will move to the highest and
     lowest possible altitude, respectively.
</ul>
See the <a href=keys.html>list of keys</a> for a more complete description
of the keys that are active within graphic windows.
