<h2>Starting Zebra</h2>

Documentation on obtaining the Zebra software and on installation can be
found in the <a
href="http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebra/doc/Release/Release.html">Zebra
release notes</a> and <a
href="http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebra/doc/Install/Install.html">Installation
manual</a>, both of are accessible through the <a
href="http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebra.html">Zebra home page</a>.<p>

Once Zebra is loaded onto your system, type <code>zstart</code> in a free
window.  Note: Do not run zstart in background.  
<p>
The <code>zstart</code> command
starts up Zebra through the following series of steps:

<ul>
<li> The first step is to try to find the project directory.  If
     <code>zstart</code> is given a parameter on the command line, it is
     expected to be the project directory.  If not, <code>zstart</code>
     first checks to see if the current directory is a project directory.
     Failing that, the user will be prompted for the name of the directory
     to use.
<p>
<li> Next <code>zstart</code> needs to find the data directory.  If the
     environment variable <code>DATA_DIR</code> is set then its value will
     be used; otherwise the user is prompted.
<p>
<li> Finally, all of the Zebra processes are started up with a properly
     configured environment.  Some project configurations include special
     startup code which will also be run by <code>zstart</code>.  For
     example, the STORMFEST configuration has code to deal with the
     possible existence of a CDROM on the system.
</ul>

<code>zstart</code> has numerous other options controlled mostly through
environment variables.  These are useful mainly to Zebra developers, but an
overview of each of them can be found in the <a
href="http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebra/doc/Intro/Intro.html">Introducing
Zebra</a> manual.

<h3>What happens when Zebra starts up</h3>

Zebra is made up of several processes which must be running for things to
work properly.  What you will see initially is the <code>zstart</code>
command starting up all of these processes.  You will see output like:

<blockquote> <pre><code>
Project dir is . 
182 colors tweaked
Starting core Zebra processes:
        message daemon [1] 4731
        event logger [2] 4734
        timer [3] 4736
[4] 4739
Loading:
     ...plot descriptions...
     ...button maps...
     ...display configurations ...
     ...ISS active area code ...
     ...the icon bar...
ready!
DM> 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

The last line is the display manager prompt.  You may type commands at that
prompt.

<p>
A set of windows will come up on the workstation.  The set of windows
displayed is dependant on the "DEFAULT_CONFIG" environment variable.  In
general the <a href=event-logger.html>Event Logger</a>, <a
href=iconbar.html>IconBar </a>, and a <a href=graphic-windows.html>
Graphics Window </a> will be displayed.
