<title>Starting Zeb</title>
<h2>Starting Zeb</h2>

Documentation on obtaining the Zeb software and installation can be found
in the <a href=http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebdoc/Install.html> Zeb release
notes, installation, and tutorial</A> option off the <a
href=http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zeb.html>Zeb home page</a>.<p>

Once Zeb is loaded onto your system, type <code>startzeb</code>	in a free
window.  Note: Do not run startzeb in background.  
<p>
The <code>startzeb</code> command
starts up zeb through the following series of steps:

<ul>
<li> The first step is to try to find the project directory.  If
     <code>startzeb</code> is given a parameter on the command line, it is
     expected to be the project directory.  If not, <code>startzeb</code>
     first checks to see if the current directory is a project directory.
     Failing that, the user will be prompted for the name of the directory
     to use.
<p>
<li> Next <code>startzeb</code> needs to find the data directory.  If the
     environment variable <code>DATA_DIR</code> is set then its value will
     be used; otherwise the user is prompted.
<p>
<li> Finally, all of the zeb processes are started up with a properly
     configured environment.  Some project configurations include special
     startup code which will also be run by <code>startzeb</code>.  For
     example, the STORMFEST configuration has code to deal with the
     possible existence of a CDROM on the system.
</ul>

<code>startzeb</code> has numerous other options controlled mostly through
environment variables.  These are mostly of use to zeb developers and are
beyond the scope of this tutorial.

<h3>What happens when zeb starts up</h3>

Zeb is made up of several processes which must be running for things to
work properly.  What you will see initially is the <code>startzeb</code>
command starting up all of these processes.  You will see output like:
<blockquote> <pre><code> Project dir is .  182 colors tweaked Starting core
zeb processes:
        message daemon [1] 4731
        event logger [2] 4734
        timer [3] 4736
[4] 4739
Loading:
     ...plot descriptions...
     ...button maps...
     ...display configurations ...
     ...ISS active area code ...
     ...the icon bar...
ready!
DM> 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
The last line is the display manager prompt.  You may type commands at that
prompt.<p>

A set of windows will come up on the workstation.  The set of windows
displayed is dependant on the "DEFAULT_CONFIG" environment variable.  In
general the <a href=event-logger.html>Event Logger</a>, <a
href=iconbar.html>IconBar </a>, and a <a href=graphic-windows.html>
Graphics Window </a> will be displayed.
