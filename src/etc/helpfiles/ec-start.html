<title>Editing: start with a close configuration</title>
<h1>Start with a close configuration</h1>

One trick to making the editing process as easy as possible is to start
with a configuration that is close to what you want.  Most Zebra setups
include a set of predefined configurations which are available; look
through them to see if anything there is of interest.  Remember that window
sizes and placement are easily changed.
<p>
If all else fails, pull up the <tt>empty</tt> configuration (which has no
graphic windows) and start from there.
