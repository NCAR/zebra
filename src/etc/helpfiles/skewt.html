<title>Skew-t plots</title>
<h1>Skew-t plots</h1>

Skew-t plots provide the traditional representation for atmospheric
soundings.

<h2>Adding data to skew-t plots</h2>

Brand-new skew-t plots start with nothing but the grid.  Soundings are
almost always added to a skew-t plot through the use of <a
href=posicons.html>active icons</a> in a horizontal plot.  Simply select
the sounding station of interest, and click on the skew-t window to produce
a plot like:
<blockquote><img src=skewt.gif></blockquote>
It is possible to add up to three soundings to a skew-t window:
<blockquote><img src=skewt3.gif></blockquote>

<p>
<h2>Removing data from skew-t plots</h2>

To remove a trace from a skew-t plot, move to the annotation at the
<b>top</b> of the skew-t window.  The name of each station will illuminate
as you move the pointer over it:
<blockquote><img src=skewt-top.gif></blockquote>
When the station you wish to remove is illuminated, simply use the
<b>left</b> mouse button to remove the trace from the window.

<h2>Other skew-t operations</h2>

The plot limits of the skew-t (temperature and pressure bounds) may be
changed via the usual <a href=limits.html>adjust limits</a> mechanism.
<p>
Some operations are available from the <b>right</b> button menu off the
sounding <img src=sounding-icon.gif> icon:
<ul>
<li> The presence of times in the top annotation may be toggled.  If you
     have disabled times in the top annotation, you may still obtain this
     information (though in an ugly form, currently), via the <a
     href=overlay-time.html>overlay times widget</a>.
<p>
<li> The <b>sounding overlay mode</b> may be toggled.  When this mode is on
     (the default), new soundings will be overlaid on the existing ones (up
     to a limit of three).  When off, a new sounding replaces any existing
     soundings in the window.
<p>
<li> The height scale may be toggled between kilometers and feet.
</ul>
