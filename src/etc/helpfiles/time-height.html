<h1>Time-height plots</h1>

Time-height plots display one or more fields in a time-height format.  They
are used primarily for upward-looking data, such as that from soundings,
wind profilers, and RASS stations.

<h2>Adding data to a time-height plot</h2>

A brand-new time-height window will start out empty:
<blockquote><img src=th-empty.gif></blockquote>
Generally, the only way to add data to a time-height window is through the
use of <a href=posicons.html>active icons</a> in a horizontal plot.  Simply
select the platform of interest and click on the time-height window to
place it there.  Selecting a wind profiler platform, for example, will
produce a display like:
<blockquote><img src=th-profile.gif></blockquote>
Note that two overlays have been added here!  One is a contoured
representation of the vertical wind (in this case); on top of that is a set
of wind barbs showing the horizontal winds.  In general, adding a platform
of a given type will cause the new platform to replace any existing
platforms of that type; if a new wind profiler is added to this window at
this point, only data from that profiler will be displayed.

<h2>Tweaking time-height contoured displays</h2>

There are no end of options available for adjusting the contoured fields in
a time-height display; only a few of them will be discussed here.  See also
<a href=interpmethods.html>adjusting interpolation</a> and <a
href=xy-contour-limits.html>adjusting xygraph contour limits</a> for other
options.
<p>
The contours can often be hard to see below the wind barbs.  Using the
<b>right</b> mouse button on the contour <img src=contour-icon.gif> icon,
you may change the contour type to <tt>filled</tt>.  The result looks
like:
<blockquote><img src=th-solid.gif></blockquote>
With the same menu you may change the color table used to generate the
contours.  Changing to a three-color table yields the following plot
<blockquote><img src=th-3color.gif></blockquote>
which strongly emphasizes the downward velocities.
<p>
The field to be contoured may be changed using the <b>middle</b> mouse
button on the contour <img src=contour-icon.gif> icon

<h2>Tweaking time-height winds displays</h2>

Many people prefer to see winds values as vectors, rather than barbs.
Through use of the <b>middle</b> mouse button on the vector <img
src=vector-icon.gif> icon, vectors may be selected.  It is also possible to
turn on color-coding of the vectors (or barbs); this feature is useful
mostly when no contours are being displayed underneath.  By performing the
above and shortening the time period, the following plot was obtained:
<blockquote><img src=th-vector.gif></blockquote>
<p>
Most other parameters of interest can be controlled through this widget:
<p><img src=th-wwidget.gif><p>
which may be obtained with the <b>middle</b> button on the vector <img
src=vector-icon.gif> icon.  Adjusting the time period in this widget has global
effect -- all overlays will be plotted with the new time period.
