<h1>Deleting windows from a display configuration</h1>

The zeb display manager provides a capability for deleting windows which
are no longer desired in a display configuration.  There are two common
ways to get to this capability.
<p>
If your icon bar gives you a configuration editing widget
<blockquote><img src=ec-confedit.gif></blockquote>
Then click on the <tt>Delete window</tt> option.  Otherwise if your iconbar
has a <tt>Delete display window</tt> entry, just select that.  In either
case, you will get the window deletion widget:
<blockquote><img src=ec-delete.gif></blockquote>
At this point, you need to provide the name of the window to be deleted.
Under most window managers, this name will appear in the title bar of the
graphic window; you can simply type it into the blank provided (be sure to
delete the dashes that are there at the beginning).  If you prefer, click
on <tt>Select with mouse</tt>, then click on the window to be deleted and
its name will be filled in for you.
<p>
Once the name is provided, think for a moment to be sure you really want to
delete the window, then click on <tt>Do it</tt>.  The window and the widget
both will disappear.
