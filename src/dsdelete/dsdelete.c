#define USAGE \
"Deletes files from the named platform.  Use with caution!\n\
All files are deleted whose times fall before a calculated cutoff time.\n\
If 'zap-time' is a number, or a UI expression which evaluates to a number,\n\
the cutoff time is that number of seconds prior to the current ZEB time.\n\
Otherwise the cutoff time is 'zap-time' interpreted as an absolute time\n\
in UI format, 'dd-mmm-yyyy[,hh:mm:ss]'.\n\
   -o\tdeletes the single observation which contains the cutoff time\n\
   -z\tdeletes the single most recent observation\n\
   -h\tprints this usage message\n\
Examples: \n\
   dsdelete -z radar                  Delete the most recent radar file\n\
   dsdelete prof915h '(3600*24)'      Delete files 24 hrs earlier and before\n\
   dsdelete -o gms 29-feb-93,4:15:42  Delete file containing the given time\n\
   dsdelete test 0                    Delete all files in platform 'test'\n"
