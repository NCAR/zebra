This directory contains a set of utility scripts for automatically
generating zebra plots as data are received in a local datastore, including
scripts for ingesting soundings and transferring files and images to remote
ftp servers, such as for JOSS.  The scripts require configuration with
environment variables which are usually set in a project's proj_env file.
The zconfig script is the gateway script which sets up a project's
environment and then runs a given script with that environment.  Most
of the scripts here will need to be run with zconfig.

The proj_env file is an example of a project environment file and contains
examples of all of the environment variables expected by the scripts here.

The Plots file is an example of the platform plotting parameters expected
by zplotd.  The file path is set in the PLOT_PLATFORMS variable in
proj_env.
