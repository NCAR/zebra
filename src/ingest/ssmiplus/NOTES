write header file which holds 1b header and data scan record structures
 ---> Done.

add option to specify 1b format and file name
 ---> Done.

Finish C++ implementation of the source and scan classes for the L1B formats.
 ---> Done.

Use ssmil1btatb.f to calculate an OUTDAT structure and then process it for
L1B same as for RSS.
 ---> Done.

In ProcessFile(), create two SquareScans, one for antenna temperatures and
one for brightness temperatures (if needed).  Either that or add space for
brightness temperatures in SquareScan and add a method AddTBOutdat for
adding an OUTDAT with brightness temperatures in it.
 ---> Using two square scans.

Add Tcl interpreter for specifying region limits, resolutions, platform
names, fields to ingest, input devices, formats, and other such parameters.
 ---> Done.

Add some Tk stuff to provide fancy feedback and maybe allow some settings
to be made or modified at startup.

Rather than have two SquareScan args in the routines in ssmi_ingest.cc,
perhaps it would be more general to pass an array of SquareScan's, and add
the ta or tb type to the class structure.

Add extended tcl and use the C++ interp object in tcl++.h

warning in SS::AddOutdat about when rolling over

test result from ReadABScan for end-of-file; add eof test to
MoreScans() also.
