There are six SSMI platforms, all with the prefix "ssmi_": 

Antenna temperatures only:

	ssmi_s2		Satellite 'craft id' 2 aka F-8
	ssmi_s4		Satellite 'craft id' 4 aka F-10
	ssmi_s5		Satellite 'craft id' 5 aka F-11

Brightness temperatures and rainfall rates:

	ssmi_s2_tb	Satellite 'craft id' 2 aka F-8
	ssmi_s4_tb	Satellite 'craft id' 4 aka F-10
	ssmi_s5_tb	Satellite 'craft id' 5 aka F-11

The data is taken from the Marshall Space Flight Center Distributed
Acitve Archive Center (MSFC DAAC).

The original data files were named Sx.*, where 'x' was the craft id as
above, using the NESDIS level 1b format.  Only satellite scans within the
general TOGA COARE region were included in the files.

For each satellite, temperatures are calculated for each of the 7
channels of the microwave imager:

	'Low' frequencies, A scans only, 64 cells per scan:
	-----
	ta19v		Antenna temperature, 19 GHz vertical polarization
	ta19h		...and so on...
	ta22v
	ta37v
	ta37h

	'High' frequencies, A and B scans, 128 cells per scan:
	-----
	ta85v
	ta85h

Likewise the low-frequency brightness temperatures fields are named

	tb19v, tb19h, tb22v, tb37v, tb37h

and the high-frequency brightness temperatures:

	tb85v, tb85h

Rainfall rates, field 'rr', are derived using Liu and Curry 1992:
JGR,97,9959-9974.

RR=5.5e-3*(TB19H-TB85H+88)**1.6, if TB37V-TB37H<38 and TB19H-TB85H+88>0
  =0                             else

RR is the rainrate in mm/hr, and the TB variables are the brightness
temperatures in Kelvin for the 85GHz, 37GHz and 19GHz channels.  H and V
indicate the Horizontal and Vertical polarizations.  The algorithm only
works over the ocean surface, but no distinction of surface type is made
when calculating RR.  Consequently, an outlandish value for rainrate
usually indicates either one of the temperatures is bad or that the cell is
located over land.  Since the calculation of rainrate depends upon
low-frequency temperatures, the rainrate is only calculated on the 64-cell
low-frequency grid of the A scans, yielding a resolution of about 25 km by
25 km.

The SSMI ingestor works by compiling consecutive scans into one set,
verifying that the scans are close to each other in time.  The lat/lon
location of each cell of each scan is converted to coordinates on a km grid
whose origin is 9.42 degrees south latitude and 159.97 degrees east
longitude (the origin of the coare CAP plots).  A grid is designed
according to the range of the scan cells and the Resolution parameter (12.5
km).  Since the high and low frequencies have different coverage, two
different mappings are generated for mapping scan cells coordinates into
kilometer grid points.  A grid point receives the closest cell within a
specific radius.  (The Radius parameter used for this dataset is 50 km.)
For each of the high- and low- mappings, the cell temperature values are
filled into the grid.  The mapping does not include any interpretation or
analysis.  Grid points which do not fall into the range of the mapping are
filled with zero.  The scale and offset for compressing the temperatures
(K) into bytes are 1 and 100, respectively.  So fill values will uncompress
temperatures of 100 K.  As long as the center and step of a raster plot do
not include 100 K, the raster plots will give a good representation of the
satellite scans (though the black fill areas in the rectangular images will
still cover any plots beneath the image).  Because of the radius limit, a
series of bad scans will appear broken up.

The parameters used to ingest this dataset, taken directly from the tcl
script:

set Format level1b			;# "rss", "level1b", or "1b"
set Resolution 12.5			;# kilometers
set MinScans 32				;# min number of scans to make an image
set DisableLimits true			;# take every scan in the file
set Radius 50.0				;# kilometers
Origin -9.42 159.97 			;# use the same origin for all images

The 85 GHz channels on F-8 are frequently bad and so raster plots will
show up as a solid color.  Even though all of the images are created with
12.5 km resolution, only the 85 GHz channels are actually sampled at that
resolution.  The low-frequency cells are about 25 km apart.

Configuration notes:

There is a module file, 'ssmi', in the modules directory, and a generic
ssmi plot component, 'tc_ssmi', in the pd directory.  The module file only
contains a field menu, and the plot description is similar to p_raster
except for setting the middle menu to the field menu in the 'ssmi' module
file.  The IconBar includes three submenus under the satellite icon menu,
one for each satellite.  Each submenu selects one of the fields for one of
the three satellites.  Icons for each of the satellite names are in the
'icons' directory.

The defaults pd (pd/defaults.pd) contains some generic center-step defaults
for each of the fields.  These are not tailored to each specific frequency
or polarization, consequently some of the plots may show up with gaps from
out-of-range values.

A simple display configuration is in dconfig/ssmi.dc.  Enter 'display ssmi'
at the dm> prompt to see it.

The source for the ingestor can be found in zeb/src/ingest/ssmiplus in the
Zeb source distribution.  This is the README file from that directory.  The
directory also contains an example of a script used to process the data
files, called ssmi.tcl.
