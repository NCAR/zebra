Usage:
	fixsonde [-v] netcdf-file ...

fixsonde has one option, -v, which turns on verbose output.  While verbose,
messages are printed about each file opened and closed, and each variable
to which the "missing_value" attribute is written.

The required arguments are one or more netcdf files.  Each file will be
opened for re-definition, and then each float variable will have the
"missing_value" attribute key added with a value of -9999.  It is OK for
the missing_value attribute to already exist, but any existing value other
than -9999 will be overwritten.

Since more than one file can be put on the command line, all of the files
can be fixed at once with

	fixsonde /apps/data/sgp/platforms/sgpsondeC1.a1/sgpsonde*.cdf

If the netCDf files are changed while Zeb is running, be sure to rescan
the files immediately after fixing them:

	dsrescan sonde

Otherwise, any graphics processes which already have the files opened will
run into synchronization problems.  If they start reporting file errors
with the sonde files, restart the display manager.

If adding a new sonde data file, just fix it before putting it into the
platform directory.
