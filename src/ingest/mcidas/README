Some info to be aware of for others who venture into this directory:

Build
=====

Buiding a libmcidas.a for Zebra from this directory requires that you
have a McIDAS source tree installed on your system.  Set the environment
variable McINST_ROOT to point to the top of your McIDAS installation,
then the build from this directory should work properly, and will create
a libmcidas.a in the Zebra library installation directory.


Implementation note
===================

The four symbols nvxeas, nvxini, nvxopt, and nvxsae are each defined 
in every McIDAS navigation module (nvx*.dlm).  The Imakefile has logic
to take these modules and massage them into .f files with unique symbol
names.  The module mcidas_nav.c (written by us, and separate from McIDAS)
in turn provides an interface to the new symbols.
