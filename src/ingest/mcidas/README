Some info to be aware of for others who venture into this directory:

Most of the source files in this directory come straight from the McIDAS 7.1
distribution, and are copyrighted by SSEC.  This directory should not 
be distributed to anyone not holding a McIDAS license.

The four symbols nvxeas, nvxini, nvxopt, and nvxsae are each defined 
in every McIDAS navigation module (nvx*.dlm).  The Imakefile has logic
to take these modules and massage them into .f files with different symbol
names.  The module mcidas_nav.c (written by us, and separate from McIDAS)
in turn provides an interface to the new symbols.
