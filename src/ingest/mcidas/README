Some info to be aware of for others who venture into this directory:

There is no source code control because all of the files here are copied
from maintained elsewhere.  The idea is to avoid changing these files
as much as possible.  

Three files each contain their own declarations for four symbols:

nvxeas
nvxini
nvxopt
nvxsae

The files are:

nvxgoes.f
nvxps.f
nvxrect.f

Each of these three files contains different declarations for each of
the symbols above.  Different ingest modules use declarations from a
specific source file out of the three.  To ensure that the correct
function is linked with the ingest module, the source file required by
an ingest module is compiled and linked to the module within that
module's source directory.  These three FORTRAN source files in this
directory are NOT compiled NOR installed into the Zeb library for this
reason.  The required source file of each ingest module is given as
follows:

NowradIngest 	requires the definitions in 	nvxrect.f
satellite 	requires the definitions in 	nvxgoes.f
