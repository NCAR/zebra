Two ingest programs: c130fest_ingest, p3fest_ingest

Both programs require a running DataStore.  Also, they are not using
the mainline DataStore source, so if you see any problems running these
programs let me know.  In the DataStore config file, the p3 and storm4 (c130)
platforms should have 'maxamples' set to 65000.

Usage:
------
c130fest_ingest <data file> <parameters>

p3fest_ingest <data file>

Examples:
---------
 c130fest_ingest flt1518.dmp /dt/granger/parameters

 p3fest_ingest p301.dat

For p3fest_ingest, the first four letters of the data file name should
unique among all of the p3 flight files.  The ingestor uses the first four
letters to generate a name suitable for the WINDS program.

The P-3 files are stored directly on the tape.  To retrieve a file, use

cat </dev/nexa >p3-1.dat

Suggested file names for P3 files are p301.dat, p302.dat, ..., p313.dat, 
and so on.

The C-130 data is in tar format:

tar xvf /dev/nexa

Names are of the form flt15??.dmp.  It does not matter what file name is
used with c130fest_ingest.

For both ingestors, the WINDS name is stored as a global attribute,
"winds_filename", in the netCDF file.  The program 'windsname' writes the
value of this attribute to stdout.  The script cdf2winds uses this program
to rename all of the netCDF files on its command line to the correct WINDS
name.  This script should be run on the DataStore directory once all of the
data files have been ingested into netCDF files.  It does not hurt to run
the script more than once; files which are already correctly named are 
ignored.  Example:

cdf2winds /scr/framboise/fest/p3/*.cdf

There are lots of debugging options in the ingest programs, use the -help
option to see them.

The program acqual can be used to make sure the ingest programs are
producing correct netCDF files, and also to measure things like
out-of-range values and number of bad-value-flags in fields lat, lon, and
alt.  Just type 'acqual' to find out more.
