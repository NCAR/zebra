		Converting Data to netCDF Format for Zeb


	The procedure for converting data in MUDRAS file format into a 
format usable by Zeb is:

1)  Acquire MUDRAS file.  If the file is on the mass store system,
    then download the file to a local machine with "nrnet msget".  
    For example:

	nrnet msget localfile L DF=BI R flnm=msfile

2)  Decide on a platform name.  The dual-Doppler example uses
    the platform name "ddop".

3)  Make a directory below the usual zeb data directory for this data.
    The directory should have the same name as the platform name.

4)  Convert the MUDRAS file to netCDF format with the "convmud" command
    which is included in the Zeb distribution.  The format of this command
    is:

	convmud mudras-file cdf-file-prefix mudras-field zeb-field ...

    Where:

	mudras-file  
		Is, strangely enough, your mudras file.
	cdf-file-prefix  
		Is the *prefix* to the file created by convmud.  It is 
		usually something like "/zeb/data/ddop/ddop.".
		The prefix will be completed with the date and time and
		a .cdf extension.
	mudras-field
		Is the bizarre name of an interesting field in the MUDRAS
		file.
	zeb-field
		Is the name to assign this field in the netCDF file.

    The convmud program accepts any number of field name pairs.  For
    example:

	convmud 2134.mud /zeb/data/ddop/ddop. "UFIL" u_wind \
	"VFIL" v_wind "CON1" div "WINT1" w_wind "ZCP4" ref_cp4 "ZCP3" ref_cp3


	Note:  It may be necessary to set some environment variables before
    running the convmud program.  
	
	GMT_OFFSET  
		The number of hours of offset between the time in the
		MUDRAS file and GMT.  For CaPE data, the value is zero.

	ORIGIN_LAT and ORIGIN_LON
		Used to override the origin given in the MUDRAS file, 
		should it happen to be junk for some reason.
		                    
5)  Let Zeb's data store know about the new platform.  A file exists in the
    project directory that is read by the data store daemon and which defines
    the platform name space.  This file is called ds.config.  Add some lines 
    like this:

	platform ddop
		organization	3dgrid
		filetype	netcdf
	endplatform

    See the Zeb Configuration Manual for more information on the ds.config
    file.

6)  Modify plot descriptions, menus etc. to allow display and access of the
    new data platform.  Generic plot descriptions already exist for the 
    platform name and fields in the above example.

7)  Restart zeb and go.  


	The procedure for converting GENPRO format files to netCDF is
similar.  Simply use the "gprotocdf" program in place of convmud.
