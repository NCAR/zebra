GriddedGOES is a trimmed-down version of SatIngest, which will remap a
McIDAS GOES area file onto a lat/lon grid and write the data to stdout.  
It does not use any of the Zebra services required by SatIngest.

Usage:

	GriddedGOES <cmdfile> <areafile>

where "cmdfile" is the name of a two line command file describing the
limits and size of the desired lat/lon grid.  The first line of the file
has the lat and lon of the SW and NE corners of the grid to generate, and
the second line number of points in the grid in the x and y directions.

Example: To generate a 1000x1000 grid from 35.5 to 40.5 in latitude and
-125.0 to -118.0 in longitude (W longitudes should be negative) from McIDAS
area file "area1.dat" and put the grid in "area1.grid":

	$ cat > cmdfile
	35.5 -125.0 40.5 -118.0
	1000 1000
	^D
	$ GriddedGOES cmdfile area1.dat > area1.grid
	

The process can take a while for large destination grids, but messages will
be written occasionally to show the progress of the program.

The format of the output is a 4 line description header followed by
the (nX x nY) bytes of gridded data.  The four description lines
contain the following information:

	1) Source, date, and time for the image
	2) Image size (nx x ny)
	3) NW corner latitude and longitude
	4) latitude and longitude step for the grid

The header can be easily viewed using the Unix "head" program and can be
stripped from the file using the "tail" program.  After the above example, 
the following would display the header and create a file "justdata" containing
only the image data with no header:

	$ head -4 area1.grid
	GOES visr image 930726 150100
	1000 x 1000
	NW corner lat: 40.50000  lon: -125.00000
	latstep: 0.00501  lonstep: 0.00701
	$ tail +5 area1.grid > justdata
