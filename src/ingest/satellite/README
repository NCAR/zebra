Info for this directory:
------------------------

festSatIngest.c has been checked in and left there, just in case anyone ever
wants to use it.

The original SatIngest has been checked in as SatIngestDO.c, since this version
uses the old DataObject interface.

The newSatIngest.c file is now SatIngest.c.  Older versions of this which had
been named newSatIngest.c.old and the like have now been checked in as older
versions of the SatIngest.c file.


To get area files from MCIDAS, use the following procedure on a MCIDAS PC,
such as the one in the RAP users room:

SEE REAL
LA <area#> <area#>
SENAA <area#> 1 EC <center-lat> <center-lon> 1
	      ^-- destination area           ^-- magnification

The <destination area> parameter determines the name of the file which the
areas info will be stored in.  In this example, the file would be 'areas001'.

The Wisconsin MCIDAS server from which the MCIDAS PC gets its info is at
128.104.83.32
