Installing dsnotice
-------------------

Uncompress and extract the tar file into a compiled zebra source tree,
under zebra/src/dsnotice.

If the imake program in zebra/config/imake has been cleaned, cd to
that directory and remake it with 'make'.

From the dsnotice directory:

	$ZEB_TOPDIR/bin/zmkmf ../.. src/dsnotice
	make mf
	make install

dsnotice should now be installed in the zebra binary directory.

Run

	dsnotice -h

to see the usage message.  Multiple instances of dsnotice can be run in the
same Zebra session if its necessary to split the output of notices on
different sets of platforms.

Bugs
----

There is one known bug with the datastore notify mechanism which always
reports overwrites with zero samples.  All the other information is
correct.  The output indicates that samples were overwritten in the named
file, its just that the number of samples overwritten is not known.
