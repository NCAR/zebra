More radars can follow, with a blank line before the start of each.  The blank
line shown before the first radar above is real; it is not just there as
a result of the comments I added to the right.

The config line specifying outgoing line and phone number is special.  If 
the first character of the line is '-', no direct communication with
the radar will be attempted.  Otherwise, the line should have the device
name to use for communicating with the radar, the phone number to dial, and
the baud rate.  For radio modems, use the string 'radio-modem' for the phone 
number.
