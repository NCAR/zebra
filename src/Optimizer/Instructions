		(Brief) Instructions for Building and Using
			the Zebra Radar Scan Optimizer
		-------------------------------------------


NOTE: The assumption is made below that you have a Zebra source
distribution in the /zebra directory, and the binary directory installed in
/zebra/bin.  Modify directory references is you have your Zebra source
elsewhere.


1) Check your /zebra/config/config.h file and make sure that you have enabled
   building of the Optimizer:

	#define BuildOptimizer YES

2) Build Optimizer:

	$ cd /zebra/src/Optimizer
	$ /zebra/bin/zmkmf ../.. src/Optimizer
	$ make install

Now go to your project-specific configuration directory.

1) Put together a radar parameters file for the Optimizer.  The format and
   contents of this file are described below.

2) Add platform "boundary" to your ds.config file.  This platform will hold
   the user-specified boundaries used by the scan optimizer.

	platform boundary
		organization	outline
		filetype	zeb
	endplatform

3) Generally, optimizer boundaries are entered via a Zebra graphics process 
   by drawing an outline on the screen.  The graphics process command to 
   enable drawing and save the result under platform "boundary" is "polyline 
   boundary".  This command can be bound to a specific key in the
   graphics process' button map.  I like to use "o" for "Optimizer":

	buttonmap example
		.
		.
		local	o	'polyline boundary'
		.
		.
	endmap

   The command can also be run from the icon menu for the optimizer
   boundary overlay component, described in the next step.  You do not need
   to change the buttonmap if you do the next step instead.

4) It is useful to have the graphics process being used for optimizing keep
   the current boundary displayed.  Add the following entry to one of the
   menus in the IconBar file, usually the "overlay" menu:

	entry 'Optimizer Boundary' 'putc1 p_opt_boundary platform boundary'

   The boundary overlay can then be added to a radar window by selecting
   this menu entry.  [Restart Zebra to get the modified IconBar menu.]

Finally, run everything.

1) Start Zebra normally and pick a display configuration with a radar window.

2) Execute the Optimizer, giving it the radar parameters file that was created
   earlier:

	/zebra/bin/Optimizer /myprojdir/my.params &

3) Add the optimizer boundary overlay to a radar window using the IconBar.

4) Enter a boundary via the graphics process.  If you added 'o' to the
   button map, as mentioned above, you can press 'o' in the radar window.
   If you added the boundary with the IconBar menu entry above, you can
   select the 'Enter boundary' entry from the right menu of the optimizer
   boundary component icon.

5) Play with the controls in the Optimizer window.

Repeat 4) and 5) as much as desired.



                        Optimizer Config File Format
                        (as of 12 July 91 16:45 GMT)
                        ----------------------------


0.7 0.7 0.4 0.4 0.0 4.0 ASAP	<-- H and V res., min. H and V separation,
				    volume bottom and top, volume scan time
CP2			<-- radar name
/dev/modem 4978836 2400	<-- device, phone #, and baud rate for communications
28.7544 -80.7747	<-- latitude and longitude
15.0 12.0		<-- maximum H and V scan rates
10.0 10.0		<-- maximum H and V accelerations
64 1024	variable	<-- minimum and maximum hits, default setting
960			<-- default PRF
disabled		<-- enabled/disabled
RHI			<-- default scan type (RHI, PPI, SUR)
5.0 0.2			<-- default minimum range and minimum elevation
constant		<-- constant/variable angle steps
512 150			<-- number of gates and gate spacing

More radars can follow, with a blank line before the start of each.  The blank
line shown before the first radar above is real; it is not just there as
a result of the comments I added to the right.

The config line specifying outgoing line and phone number is special.  If 
the first character of the line is '-', no direct communication with
the radar will be attempted.  Otherwise, the line should have the device
name to use for communicating with the radar, the phone number to dial, and
the baud rate.  For radio modems, use the string 'radio-modem' for the phone 
number.
