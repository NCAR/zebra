Fri Nov  5 15:00:25 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Tagging version V3-5.

Thu Nov  4 09:24:43 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Fixed a "never should have worked" bug in dsmanage when loading
	data from CD.  Also changed the default CD name to "/cd".

Wed Oct 27 14:18:01 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Lots and lots of changes for the HPUX port.

	* Added the ability write a single, large, combined data store
	cache file which contains all platforms.  If the daemon config file
	defines the variable "ConfigFile", it is expected to the the name
	of one of these big files and loaded according; in this case, any
	per-platform cache files are IGNORED.

	Wonder why we would want to do this?  Essentially it's for CDROM
	users who (1) want to get going faster, and (2) want to be able to
	use a newer version of the software without enduring lots of "cache
	version mismatch" messages and a 20-minute daemon startup...

Mon Oct 18 13:30:43 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Numerous active area tweaks, especially with station plots.  You
	may now click on the field annotation to easily change what appears
	in each quad (given the right configuration, of course).

Fri Oct 15 10:31:25 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added active areas to xygraph annotation.

	* Fixed the "vanishing annotation" problem that appeared in numerous
	CAP plot types when the scale value was > 1.

	* Demoted some annoying xygraph babble to EF_DEBUG

Thu Oct 14 14:12:27 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added the "active areas" capability to gp.  Active areas are
	essentially icons which appear within the graphics windows, and
	which can have menus attached to them.  They are not implemented
	like the base icons, though, in that they are not separate widgets
	(for performance reasons).  So far, station plots, lightning,
	boundaries, and tracks can have active icons.

	* Added some CLF's to dm: NthColor to get the Nth color out of a
	color table; nvalue to get the number of (comma-separated) values
	for a PD parameter; pd_complist to return a foreach-able list of
	components from a PD.

Thu Oct  7 10:07:52 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added the "plot-hold" parameter.  If present in the global 
	component, and true, no plotting will be done.  The purpose is
	to allow the tweaking of multiple parameters from dm (or from
	icons, eventually) without replots happening in the middle.

	* Reworked xygraph (simple) side annotation to be more useful and
	legible.  Time stamps still appear, but may be disabled by setting
	[xy-]time-annot to false.

	* Added a function ParseLine to do what CommaParse does, but with
	an arbitrary delimiter.  Then made CommaParse use it.

Fri Oct  1 15:03:37 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/Annotate.c: Fixed An_ColorNumber() so it works correctly for 
	color tables with an even number of colors.  Andy's change a while
	ago to reverse the order of the labels worked correctly only for
	color tables with an odd number of colors.

Thu Sep 30 15:45:16 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Fixed dc_NSpace.c bug where static field data got overwritten
	unless added first or last to the DataChunk.

	* netCDF improvements: add null terminators to att strings, create
	the conventional field atts (long_name, etc) first, accept 
	missing_value's of non-float type

	* moved emacs local variables in ChangeLog to bottom of file, where
	it won't get messed up by add-change-log-entry; extended the 
	outline-regexp expression---change it back if you don't like it

Mon Sep 27 14:37:10 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Fixed a memory leak associated with the plot description
	monitoring system.  Testcenter is good for something after all.

	* Allow the specification of only a single field for "simple"
	xygraphs, even in the presence of multiple platforms.  The obvious
	thing is done.  Fixed a bug with the old attempt to provide this
	behavior with "time".

	* Removed most widgets from the "GraphProc.widgets" file.  They
	are now autoloaded through the "require" mechanism.

	* Added autoscaling to contour plots and color-coded track plots.
	If "scale-mode" is "auto", center and step values will be
	determined automatically.  Default is not to do this, so that old
	PD's don't start acting in new, unexpected ways.

	* Added new CL functions PDParam and PDSearch which function just
	like the old pd_param and pd_paramsearch, but which only return
	parameters as strings and thus do not need the final data type
	argument.

	* Added an "extras" capability to the FieldMenu so that non-field
	options can be presented in the menu.  Used for adding "station"
	to station plots and so on.

	* Added the "require" capability to load chunks of UI code once
	when actually needed.


Mon Sep 20 11:21:41 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp
	Vector representation is now supported on cross-section plots.
	This involved an *extensive* thrashing of the way XSection.c does
	its work, so this revision will be a significant source of
	potential bugs.  Testing hasn't turned up anything, though, so I
	have my fingers crossed.
	

Thu Sep 16 10:38:41 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp
	Contour and FilledContour now create only one GC each, rather than
	creating a new one for each contour drawn.  

	* gp
	Annotations generated by routines in Annotate.c now put them a 
	couple of pixels further to the right, so they don't overlay the 
	edge of the plotting area.

Thu Sep  9 11:40:27 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* dm: fixed a bug introduced by a previous change wherein a
	restarted window would no longer keep its PD, but would instead
	revert back to the original one.

	(NOTE) If the "*" line contains a good line-line description
	of the changes, nice things can be done with outline mode in
	emacs...

Tue Sep  7 17:01:13 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* EventLogger: Popup window for controlling a log file and the
	log file's event mask separately.

Thu Sep  2 02:38:57 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* DataStore: ds_DeleteObs() added, ds_DeleteData() bug fixed
	New API function ds_DeleteObs().  Bug fixes for ds_ForceRescan() and
	ds_DeleteData().  Improvements to ZNF block overwrites and file growth.

	* dsdelete: Allows deletion of specific observations by absolute time.

Thu Aug 26 14:14:14 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* gp
	Added MapPath and IconPath (both internal and UI indirect variables)
	as search paths for icons and maps.  Default value for IconPath is
	"/zeb/lib/icons,./icons" (/zeb/lib is really the library directory, of
	course); for MapPath it's "/zeb/lib,./maps".

	* dm
	Carved out the FindFile routine.

	* zeb library
	Added the FindFile routine to the zeb library.
	Useful for digging through a series of directories looking for a
	file.

Fri Aug 13 13:09:00 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* ZNF now has block append and overwrite capability through 
	ds_StoreBlocks(), but overwrite efficiency is limited to always
	storing the same fields in the file.

Thu Aug  5 12:18:02 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagged revision V3-4

	* data store, dsdelete
	dsdelete now takes an absolute date instead of an offset for
	deletion.  Offsets are still handled, but go from the current time
	(as known by the timer) rather than the latest file date.
	ds_Store refuses to store data way in the future.  ("Way"
	determined by the number of seconds in the MaxFuture indirect
	variable -- default one hour).

Wed Aug  4 11:45:44 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@stout)

	* Zeb now compiles under SunOS 5.0 (Solaris), using GNU's gcc and
	MIT's X11R5.

Thu Jul 29 10:56:37 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagged revision V3-3.

	* XY*.c and config.h
	Lots of character arrays in XY*.c were hardcoded at 80, which was
	found (the hard way) to be too short for the ARM folks.  I added
	some parameters to the end of config.h that can be changed, and
	set up the XYgraph routines to use them.

Mon Jul 26 13:49:47 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* ingest/satellite/SatIngest.c
	There is now a "truncate" option that allows multi-byte data to
	be ingested by lopping off all but the highest order byte of
	the data.  Previously, only one byte data could be ingested.

Fri Jul 23 14:22:03 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/XYGraph.c
	Restored date of data to side annotation at Charlie Martin's
	request.

Wed Jul 21 09:56:31 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* dsdwidget
	Date is now shown on end times as well as begin times for files in
	the platform_data widget, since the files may span multiple days.

Tue Jul 20 14:08:44 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* message
	Fixed an omission wherein the unix domain socket would fail to be
	removed if ZEB_SOCKET was defined.

Fri Jul 16 10:06:57 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* ds
	F_DeclareField now refuses (silently) to overwrite an existing
	field definition.  This change was needed to keep long
	descriptions from getting lost when the netCDF module defines
	fields found in a file.

	* gp
	Added a new magic pulldown menu called "FieldMenu."  This one will
	automatically generate a set of available fields and display it in
	the menu.  The user may then use the menu to change to a new field.

Tue Jul 13 19:59:31 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/XSection.c
	New plot description parameters "z-min" and "z-max" have been added
	to control the vertical limits of cross section plots.

Tue Jul 13 15:21:39 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Everything:
	V3-2 tagged and shipped out to ARM.

Fri Jul  9 00:03:51 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@steam)

	* DataStore: ds_StoreBlocks()
	ds_StoreBlocks() bug fixed which improperly handled the addition
	of new files prior to existing data files.

	* DataStore: 'maxsamples' bug
	Fixed bug which allowed more than 'maxsamples' samples to be
	written to a platform's data file.

	* Added the ChangeLog file to the top-level directory of Zeb.  All
	major changes and bug fixes in any part of Zeb will be mentioned
	in this file.  This file lists a history of changes of importance
	and interest to the end user.
