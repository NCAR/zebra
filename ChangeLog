2002-01-18  Gary Granger  <granger@mead.atd.ucar.edu>

	* Generalize file boundary time periods with 'splitseconds'
	  platform attribute.

2001-12-01  Gary Granger  <granger@ale.atd.ucar.edu>
	
	* Add tooltips to UI iconbar menus and graphics process icons
	  using LiteClue widget.

	* Allow UI RdssMenus to stay popped up with a click and release rather
	  always requiring click and drag.  Click and drag still work though.
	  Replace Athena SimpleMenu everywhere with RdssMenu.

2001-06-19  Gary Granger  <granger@ale.atd.ucar.edu>

	* Popup UI widgets near the X pointer where they will be more
	  immediately and more consistently accessible, and more obvious.
	  This uses a new uw_PositionWidget() UI function.

2000-12-08  Gary Granger  <granger@ale.atd.ucar.edu>

	* The enter-widget and hardcopy-widget have been taken out of the
	  dm.widgets load file and put in their own modules.  Older
	  projects which need them will need to explicitly require them,
	  such as in dm.config or in the iconbar commands which pop them
	  up.

2000-12-05  Gary Granger  <granger@ale.atd.ucar.edu>

	* Moved the gp ui require function to the library and use it in dm
	  and dsDaemon, allowing more config files to be moved into the
	  library and allowing configuration files to be more easily
	  shared between among projects.

	* Add a FieldSelect widget to the graphics process which can be
	  popped up with the 'selectfield' ui command and from FieldMenu.
	  Both FieldMenu and selectfield share a common spec string,
	  passed in the FieldMenu parameter value or as the selectfield
	  argument, which sets options like the field parameter to change
	  or the field select command to use.

	* Add the IconBar.sh script to the dm library.  It can be used by
	  a project to generate the usual iconbar boilerplate to which can
	  be added only the parts unique to a project.
	
	* Change the add-data-command approach for some of the window
	  templates, where the add command pops up a widget which provides
	  the options for adding a particular platform.  Components for
	  the templates are taken from the -components.pd files.  The
	  xygraph modules can now control more of the axes and side
	  annotation parameters.
	
1999-11-23  Gary Granger  <granger@ale.atd.ucar.edu>

	* Developments in the Archiver and ingest scheduler (is) programs
	  for the Integrated Sounding System have been merged back into
	  Zebra.  Both can now run in the background without an X display
	  or terminal.  An X interface for the Archiver can be opened on
	  any X display, even after the Archiver has been started in the
	  background.  The ingest scheduler supports the 'zrun' command
	  protocol so that UI commands can be sent to is from any
	  terminal.

Fri Nov 21 13:41:29 1997  Chris Burghart  <burghart@saaz.atd.ucar.edu>

	* This is the big field derivation addition.  With this addition,
 	  a C++ compiler becomes required for Zebra, as does Unidata's
 	  udunits library.  The old external interface to the data store
 	  remains essentially intact (F_Alias() now generates a complaint)
 	  and new functions have been added.  See the documentation on
 	  field derivation for more information.

	  Existing files that received significant to major thrashing:
	          Imakefile DFA_Appl.c DFA_NetCDF.c dc_NSpace.c

	  Existing files that received minor thrashing:
	  	DFA_HDF.c
		DataChunkP.h
		DataStore.h
		T_NSpace.c
		T_Utils.c
		apple.c
		dc_MetAttr.c
		dc_MetData.c
		ds_fields.h

	  New modules:
	        DerivNode.cc    -- class for derivation nodes
		DerivNode.h     -- header for DerivNode.cc
		DerivTable.cc   -- class for tables of derivation trees
		DerivTable.h    -- header for DerivTable.cc
		Derivations     -- default derivation definitions
		FDParse.bison   -- bison field derivation parser definition
		FDParse.tab.cc  -- bison-generated file (from FDParse.bison)
		FDParse.tab.h   -- bison-generated header (from FDParse.bison)
		FDScan.cc       -- flex-generated file (from FDScan.flex)
		FDScan.flex     -- flex field derivation token definitions
		Field.cc        -- field class
		Field.h         -- header for Field.cc
		T_Derivations.c -- field derivation test module
		ds_Derive.cc    -- functions for field derivation (C bindings)
		ds_fields.cc (replaces Fields.c)

	  Removed modules:
		Fields.c (replaced by ds_fields.cc, to parallel ds_fields.h)

Tue Jul  1 14:26:02 1997  Gary Granger  <granger@steam.atd.ucar.edu>

	* Merge V4_2_alpha_ARM patches up to patchlevel 3:
	  implicit coordinate variables fix in DFA_NetCDF; verify
	  d_Notify fix: use num overwritten for nsample if UpdOverwrite
	
 	* config.h: add CFG_FULL_YEARS and CFG_WARN_FIELD_NAMES

	* Merge V4_2_Juneau up to Tag_Branch_Juneau_KC:
	  add keep-colors parameter; more proportional wind barbs

Tue Nov 26 14:00:33 1996  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* config.h: critical parameters have been reconciled between ARM
	  and RDP.  Field name/desc/units lengths increased to ARM limit,
	  platform name length decreased to save space while still longer
	  than any name ever used, and filename length increased to at
	  least ARM limit.  These changes, along with cleaner and
	  non-automatic bad value handling mentioned below, should keep
	  Zebra compatible between both ARM and RDP installations without
	  recompiling.

	* DataStore: netCDF i/o tries to closely match datachunk and file:
	  all automatic attributes missing_value, units, and long_name,
	  are only added to the file if non-existent in the datachunk;
	  when reading, global and field bad value attributes are only set
	  in the datachunk if they exist in the file; no filling occurs
	  unless requesting a non-existent field or explicitly requested
	  in the details

Mon Nov 18 13:51:00 1996  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* DataStore: return non-float data as float in dc_GetScalar()

	* Daemon and gp accept multiple init files on command line

	* library: Expect and Profile interfaces for application testing
	  and profiling

	* Imake: fewer global make variable settings; compiler command
	  lines limited to only what a module needs to compile

	* multiple EventLoggers allowed per message manager session

	* dsdwidget: start-up time greatly reduced for large datasets

	* dsdump: add -f and -g options for printing file paths

	* dsnotice: new utility for printing real-time daemon notifications

	* version.h and version.c added to lib: version and copyright
	  options added to major programs

	* DataStore: field-specific bad values; microsecond handling in
	  DFA and GetList and bug fix in netcdf; extensive test suite;
	  greater intelligence at DFA level and fewer redundant algorithms
	  among file formats; more efficient netcdf interface; field name
	  checking; standalone mode; platform class and instance
	  definition protocol and API; ds_Store replaced with
	  ds_StoreBlocks; datachunks optimized to use local pointers but
	  provide serialization methods; bug fix for number of samples in
	  overwrite notifications

	* imake: installs files in bin and lib to allow compiling and
	  linking from a binary distribution

	* gp: FORTRAN no longer required; uses C versions instead

Sun Apr 27 23:33:54 1997  Gary Granger  <granger@steam.atd.ucar.edu>

	* Juneau Branch: add keep-colors qualified global component
 	  parameter to graphics process to avoid continually re-allocating
 	  colors

Wed Feb  7 09:49:03 1996  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* --- Version 4.2 --- tagged and branched.

Tue Jan 16 17:29:04 1996  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* ds: force close-and-open of netCDF files to work around ncsync
	  bug; daemon debug mode logs messages to stdout; datastore
	  testing more thorough and simplified

Thu Sep 21 16:03:08 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* gp: parameters exist and are respected for all layout regions;
	  layout menu added to gp load file; added layout help topic

Thu Aug 31 04:00:42 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* daemon: name=value command line options to override config file

	* datastore: add DelayDataDirs option, which delays creating data
	  directories until a file needs to be created there

	* datastore: insert a pseudo-unique key in cache file names to
	  allow different versions and compile configurations to easily
	  share the same data directory tree

Tue Jul 11 17:11:41 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* rearrange time widget yet again: separate help and quit buttons
	  into their own bounding box; collect "hot times" interface into
	  its own bounding box on bottom row of widget; move window
	  control menu back to its original upper right position; install
	  accelerators from "remember" button to the text window; label
	  hot time text window more clearly; update historytime help page

Thu Jun 22 09:48:33 1995  Chris Burghart  <burghart@saaz.atd.ucar.edu>

	* gp: (PlotControl.c) The microseconds portion of PlotTime is now 
	  forced to 999999, since we only get our time from the plot
	  description to the second.  This solves a problem where the
	  DefaultDataAvail gp function builds a command to set the
	  plot time, but can only encode it to the second.  Hence, a
	  data time of 1-jan-70,00:00:00.2 would cause a requested
	  plot time of 1-jan-70,00:00:00.  Since the data were *after*
	  the requested time, they weren't plotted.

Thu May 25 09:41:44 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged modules zebra, ui, and util: V4_2_alpha_ARM

	* imake R6 transition: significant changes in the directory
	  structure, project rules, project template, and Imakefiles to
	  accomodate Release 6 of imake.

	* combined builds of RDSS ui and util with BuildRDSS symbol

Mon May  8 13:26:57 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* display manager: defaults to singleton mode (-single); -multiple
	  option exists to force multiple mode.  The first display manager
	  in a session can run -single (the usual case), and additional ones
	  must use -multiple.

Thu Apr 27 08:55:32 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* time widget: menu for deleting times and controlling windows

	* display manager: -single option to get original behavior,
	  better choices when mapping processes to windows, and force a
	  new process when restarting windows

Tue Apr 25 14:56:49 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* ds and prt_Notify: added d_Notify module to ds library so that
	  prt_Notify can link to it instead of a duplicate source copy

Wed Apr 19 14:56:49 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* -+- ARM science team meeting and cotemporary changes -+-

	o   The display manager overhaul which maps configuration windows to
	    'process classes', taking care of giving each forked process a
	    unique message handle and mapping window names to process
	    names.  Multiple display manager sessions can run independently
	    under the same message manager, in theory.

	    Window geometry taken from the top-level shell window and not
	    the window manager parent window; dm clients set static window
	    gravity to prevent window managers (all except for mwm) from
	    shifting the window when reparented.

	o   Looser plot description syntax.  The syntax now looks something
	    like this:

		<component name><newline>
		<parameter name>:<parameter value><newline>
		...
		<component name><newline>
		...

	    White space is allowed anywhere; no tabs are required
	    anywhere.  Comments (!) can be anywhere and cause text between
	    '!' and the next newline to be skipped.  Blank lines are
	    allowed.  The new syntax is backwards compatible.

	    A program called pdcheck will read plot description files
	    named on the command line and report warnings (like empty
	    components or parameter values) to the terminal.

	o   New GRIB grid types for MM5 6.67 km sigma-level grids and RUC.
	    GRIBdump will show Grid Description Sections now, and
	    DFA_GRIB has been modularized a little further to make it easier
	    to add polar stereographic projections (and other projections).

	o   Lots of DFA_NetCDF.c changes to accept the variety of ARM
	    "conventions" in their netCDF files.  Irregular grids whose
	    stations have a height dimension (wind profiler demo network)
	    can be sliced by altitude and stepped through like 3-D regular
	    grids.  Lots more flexibility in accepting times and different
	    variable and dimension names.

	o   Lots of cleaning up in the library, trying to make sure 
	    everything is prototyped where it should be.  The message 
	    interface supports an 'unconnected' mode so that programs can
	    use the library even when msg_ELog calls might otherwise cause
	    errors from lack of a message socket.

	o   A "hot times" menu in the time widget.  The time widget provides
	    a menu of times and descriptions for which applications can 
	    request callbacks on changes.  The display manager uses it to
	    save times in a file as a user adds them through the time
	    widget.

	o   Active time labels in top annotation of graphics processes.

	o   An "auto build" configuration capability.  The project template
	    file recognizes an AutoBuild symbol which causes it to include
	    Build.tmpl rather than config.h.  Build.tmpl automatically
	    defines configuration symbols according to the architecture, so
	    we can use it to choose particular configurations (e.g. static,
	    cc or gcc) from the make command line.  A build script and
	    crontab file in CVSROOT uses auto builds to periodically update
	    and build Zebra trees on each architecture, reporting build 
	    errors to people by email.

Sun Feb  5 01:27:24 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* mstatus on internet hosts; defines for group names and display
	  manager name; better memory tracking in message manager; -Wall
	  checks done on message manager

Fri Feb  3 01:30:01 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* dm: if MosaicPath defined in config.h, try to exec that first;
	  MosaicPath indirect variable added to dm; -Wall checks on dm

	* config.h: optional build and distribution of xhelp, using
	  DistributeXHelp and BuildXHelp symbols.  dm support for xhelp is
	  not compiled if BuildXHelp is true (SUPPORT_XHELP will not be
	  defined in config.h).

	* message: detect malloc failures, debugging, elog, host table: now
	  more robust about detecting and recovering from memory overruns
	  (copying strings which don't fit) and malloc failures; extended
	  logging used, so that log messages have a level and can be
	  directed to stdout when debugging; lots of cmd-line options and
	  usage info added; host tables for mapping message handler names
	  to Internet address and port (supports multiple message sessions
	  running on a single machine connected via loopback); detects
	  namespace collisions and tries to kill the existing client before
	  replacing it with the new one; cleans up delayed write queues
	  when client disconnects; frees all memory on exit so that dynamic
	  memory checking can detect leaks.

	* msg_ping: cmd-line selection of client or host ping protocol

	* datstore protocol change: int file indices and inode support:
	  daemon detects inode changes and tells clients to close and
	  re-open the file, while mtime changes handled as before; 
	  upper limit on data files is now (2^32).

Tue Jan 31 09:37:40 1995  Chris Burghart  (burghart@fuggles.atd.ucar.edu)

	* zstart: We now add /zeb/lib/resources to  XFILESEARCHPATH rather 
	  than using XAPPLRESDIR, which fails if the LANG environment variable 
	  is set.  The extra pieces which set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH have been 
	  removed.

Thu Jan 26 17:00:00 1995  Chris Burghart  (burghart@fuggles.atd.ucar.edu)

	* dsmanage (DLoad.cc): Added function ExtractDirPlat(), which deals 
	  with platform names containing a slash a bit more robustly than the 
	  previous method.  It's still a KLUGE, though...

Thu Jan 19 11:53:39 1995  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* config symbols for field name and units string lengths, and
	  for maximum field id in fields table; ARM project settings

	* alternative time formats in netcdf files: accept either
	  time_offset or time variables, of types double, float, or long;
	  reference time for 'time' variable contained in units attribute
	  using udunits syntax; any alternative can be chosen at file
	  creation using details

Sat Dec  3 00:24:57 1994  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* ds: V4-0-patches merged up to patchlevel 3: convert netcdf
	  character array atts to strings for ARM; return all attribute
	  keys, even non-string-values, in dca_GetAttrList

Mon Nov 21 16:03:28 1994  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia.atd.ucar.edu>

	* ds, lib: move RGrid and ScaleInfo from DataStore.h to defs.h

Sun Nov 20 15:42:00 1994  Gary Granger  <granger@narnia>

	* dm: fix pickwin to agree with documentation; change recent pd
	  command additions to pdstore, pdwrite, and pdshow

	* dm: newpd and exchange commands check for string expressions
	  rather than crashing dm when args are not quoted; list cmd takes
	  optional single config name; list_cfg tolerant of nongraphic and
	  widget windows

Thu Nov 17 15:18:04 1994  Chris Burghart  (burghart@fuggles)

	* Merge of ModelCD_branch.  See log messages below.

============================================================================
======== ModelCD_branch log ================================================
============================================================================

Fri Nov  4 08:58:56 1994  Chris Burghart  (burghart@fuggles)

        Final ModelCD_branch changes before CD release!

        * gp/AxisControl.c: Added a sanity check so that no more than
          150 tics are drawn on a given axis.

        * dm/dm_config.c: UpdateConfig() now backs up through ancestor windows
          until it finds a child of root.  That window's x,y position 
          (presumably absolute w.r.t. the screen) is used for the "official"
          x,y.

Fri Oct 21 10:58:51 1994  Chris Burghart  (burghart@fuggles)

	These are my changes along the ModelCD_branch branch of Zeb as of 
	the ModelCD_proof2 tag:

	* Imake: tweaked the hp.cf for ranlib and SVR4 problems and added 
	  "-ldl" to Solaris system libraries in sun.cf.

	* EventLogger: Added an X event loop to wm() so that it now waits for 
	  a ReparentNotify event from the X server before trying to re-popup 
	  a window that's being moved from window manager control to display 
	  manager control.  If we don't wait, timing of the ReparentNotify may 
	  cause the window to be unmapped after we pop it up, never to be seen 
	  again.

	* ds library: The old ds_GetRgridParams() has now become the slightly 
	  more generic ds_GetAlts().  Added ds_IsModelPlatform() and 
	  ds_GetForecastTimes() functions.  DFA_GRIB.c got some minor syntax
	  changes to make it more palatable to various compilers, and 
	  grb_GetFields() now returns a boolean (as dnc_GetFields() does).

	* dsmanage: The new gcc (2.6.0) doesn't like defaults declared in both 
	  the method prototype in a class definition and in the method's 
	  definition.  Default parameters are now only specified in the method 
	  prototypes.

	* etc/gplib:
		contour: When contours are changed to filled-contour 
			 representation, they are now moved to the bottom 
			 of the component list.
		winds: New menu winds-model-right.

	* etc/helpfiles: Made current with model CD info.

	* gp:
		Icons.c: Improved handling of icon-age-limit for model data
		PlotControl.c: Adjustment of PlotTime based on model validation
				mode now takes place here.
		DrawText.c & sfont_1.c: Fixed a problem with stroke fonts that 
				was a result of the SGI cc compiler using 
				unsigned chars by default.
		FieldMenu.c: units are now displayed in the menu along with the
				field names.
		ModelWidget.c: Added catches so that we don't try to use the 
				PD if we don't have one.
		ConstAltPlot.c: Wind barbs can now be selected in place of
				wind vectors.
	* lib: The graphics widget now tries harder to use the default visual 
		of the screen to which it's connected.  Failing that, it also 
		deals better with the case where the default visual cannot be 
		used.

Thu Oct  6 09:32:05 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* dsrescan: add -remote flag for resetting RDirConst flag in
	  daemon before rescanning

	* dsdwidget: fix bug with empty remote data sources

	* dsmanage: handle overlapping files in index and duplicate
	  entries between platforms when both moving and deleting files;
	  exits on message handler shutdown

Fri Sep 23 19:59:21 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* dm commands: add cycle command to restart dm; initialize
	  ConfigDir, ConfigPD, and ConfigPath to empty strings; add
	  cfgconvert command to write an existing config as a single file;
	  add storepd command to save a pd to a file under a new name

	* gp: fix DataMenu and FieldMenu bugs; fix platform list lengths.
	  strings for storing platform and field parameter values, which
	  can be very long lists, are all allocated to the same big number

============================================================================
======== end of ModelCD_branch log ==========================================
============================================================================

Thu Nov  3 13:54:30 1994  Gary Granger  <granger@steam>

	* library: define default directories on compile command line,
	  eliminating the quoted versions from config.h, and forcing all
	  programs which still used the cpp defs to use the ConfigVars
	  functions; added GetDataDir() to ConfigVars.c

Tue Sep 20 16:46:08 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* AltControl.c: If radar-space isn't defined in the component of
	  interest, give global a chance.  Further perpetuation of one of
	  the ugliest kludges in the entire graphics process.

Fri Sep 16 11:03:23 1994  Jonathan Corbet  <corbet@ale>

	* InsertWidget.c Don't mangle the time after inserting boundaries.

Fri Sep 16 10:15:21 1994  Jonathan Corbet  <corbet@ale>

	* Everything: Merged in the Toulouse branch.

Tue Jun 28 14:04:24 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* ds: A read-only format driver for the GRADS format has been
	  added.

Tue Jun  7 16:08:42 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* gp: Store the user coordinates of button events in "buttonx" and
	  "buttony" so that UI procedures can get at them.
	  
	* dm: made configpath work right.  It never, ever could have in
	  the past.  Also attempt (silently) to create ConfigDir before
	  saving a configuration.

Wed May 18 16:05:54 1994  Chris Burghart  (burghart@fuggles)

	* dsDaemon: Changed variables Genesis, LastScan, and LastCache from
	  ZebTime to time_t.  This is mainly to keep the daemon from trying
	  to send a message to the timer process after it's already dead
	  (i.e., during a WriteCache() call at shutdown time).

Wed May  4 15:15:22 1994  Chris Burghart  (burghart@fuggles)

	* ds/d_Config.c: Fixed an insidious little bug that could 
	  cause subplatform definition to fail if a platform table or class
	  table resize happened while handling a line full of subplatform
	  declarations.  We now keep a local copy of the parent name string
	  as well as redoing the parent lookup after each subplatform
	  definition.  Ugly, but necessary.

Tue Apr 19 16:07:21 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@fuggles)

	* Changed around definition of FINITE in gp to avoid HP weirdness,
	  and moved it so it's only defined in one place.

	  Fix an "it could have never worked" bug in FieldMenu.

Fri Apr 15 16:00:00 1994  Chris Burghart  (burghart@fuggles)

	* gp: Merged "Branch_alt_and_nspace" branch back into the trunk.  This
	  branch includes a number of enhancements and fixes.  Two very 
	  notable changes occurred: First, altitude control has changed
	  radically.  There is now a notion of altitude units associated with
	  with locations in Transparent class data chunks.  This information
	  is used in altitude control, which means that we can now step through
	  pressure levels, altitude levels in km, etc.  Second, some basic 
	  handling for certain NSpace data chunks has been added to both 
	  constant altitude plots (via GridAccess.c) and cross section plots.

	* ds: Merged "Branch_alt_control" branch into the trunk.  Two major
	  changes are here.  First, the notion of altitude units has been 
	  added to locations in Transparent class data chunks.  This allows 
	  different sorts of grids (i.e., those defined by pressure level 
	  rather than altitude) to be stored and interpreted without fuss.  
	  Second, the official addition of support for GRIB format data files
	  (DFA_GRIB.c) comes with this merge.

Tue May 24 03:04:57 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@steam)

	* dm: yanked DM_GEOMETRY method until I figure out why olwm 
	  never seems to do the same thing twice (#$%^@#!&)

Mon May 23 20:50:35 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@steam)

	* --- Branch_LANTEX changes ---

	* TimeSeries.c: fixed a bug in axis tic labels which I introduced
	  in the Solaris port

	* lib: add msg_myname() function to msg_lib.c, use this to set
	  c$msgname in SetupConfigVariables(); used by gp to send its 
	  boundary to another window

	* config.h.dist: removed /*/ constructs, inserted default defn
	  for XCOMM, use UNQUOTED_DIRDEFS instead of MAKING_MAKEFILE

	* Ingest state files: changed /rdss/ui/ui_commands to #ui$defs_file

	* dm: SaveConfig() uses DM_GEOMETRY to query clients for geometry
	  info (retrieved from top-level-shell resources: location is WM
	  parent window location, size is the size of the shell window 
	  itself); tested under olwm and vtwm.  Re-arranged message types
	  in dm protocol since there was some overlap.

	* dm: fixed bug in KillProcess which would accidentally remove
	  windows from a configuration; added 'reuse' and 'rename' options
	  to dm newwindow command: rename generates unique window names 
	  automatically

	* gp: fixed station plots to correlate with side annotation
	  quadrant active areas

	* message.c: MTAP case moved *above* MT_PING so that pings which
	  fall through don't fall into MT_TAP.  Accept both MT_PING and
	  MT_CPING for pings to the message handler, since the handler
	  checks for its own name anyway.

	* zmon.c and msg_ping.c: Send MT_CPING in all cases, regardless of
	  whether pinging a message client or the handler itself.  Zmon
	  now accepts redundant host and process names in the config file.

	* '/' in platform names removed to get cache file names.

	* Archiver: tar command line now limited to what fits into the
	  command line buffer; dumpdate method improved

	* ConfigVars.c: tries Basedir/project/ZEB_PROJECT first, and if no
	  access tries Basedir/ZEB_PROJECT, and finally resorts to "." if
	  necessary.  If ZEB_PROJECT begins with a '/', accept the value
	  as an absolute path to the project directory.

	* icons: use $(INSTALL) to overwrite read-only installed files

Thu May 19 19:59:00 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* dm: Define plot descriptions with dm commands.  Configs saved
	  as a single file, complete with plot descriptions.  Includes new
	  'showpd' command.

Wed May 11 17:45:05 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* ds: Platform class and instance hierarchies added.  Primitive
	  debugging options.  More stats in query responses.

Mon May  9 16:42:08 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* dm: Replaced the obnoxious old "new window" widget with a
	  simpler one.  "Popup OldNewWindow" to get the old version.

	* gp: Added the option to activate the field names in xygraph 
	  (simple) side annotation.

	  Fixed an ugly bug in XYContour which would produce a color bar
	  on the side with random numbers.

Tue May  3 10:34:32 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* message: will no longer create and listen on an internet socket
	  unless the -i flag is present.

Tue Apr 26 14:23:08 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* gp: fixed a problem with the field menu when used from annot
	  active areas.

	* DFA_NetCDF.c: fixed a nasty free(random) bug.  Chalk up another
	  one for testcenter

Fri Mar 18 09:42:56 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* dm.c: Reset tbspace back to 0 by default.  My other change was
	  rather ill-advised.

Fri Mar  4 14:30:48 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

        * Fixed an unitialized variable problem in dsDaemon that would
	  cause lots of ugly garbage on the screen on exit, occasionally.

Mon Feb 14 09:29:49 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* ActiveArea.c Fixed a silly off-by-one error that was causing
	  unsightly core dumps.

	* FrameCache.c: Thrashed up and cleaned the code; no functionality
	  change.

Thu Feb 10 14:08:45 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* AxisControl.c: fix a couple of XDrawLine calls which were trying
	  to pass floating-point coordinates.

        * There is some confusion about what should be done in
	  px_GlobalPlot and what belongs elsewhere.  I have moved some
	  stuff around so that the right thing happens in the right order.
	  This code needs some review in the future...

Thu Feb  3 14:45:32 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@steam)

	* Tagging version V4.0.

Wed Feb  2 15:31:43 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* config: config.h promises that if you're using openwin and you
	  don't specify XIncDir that it will pick the open windows include
	  directory, but it warn't so.

	  Changed the strings /**/# to XCOMM, since the former produced an
	  intolerable number of gripes from the solaris compiler.

Tue Feb  1 13:44:06 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

        * Dsmanage: some solaris tweaks so that free space gets calculated
	  right.  Also it now looks for the ZEB_CDROM environment variable
	  to find the CDROM, if any.

Tue Feb  1 11:38:24 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@steam)

	* Fixed a NASTY free-unallocated-memory bug in XYWind.c.  If it 
	  weren't for TestCenter, I don't know how I would have found this
	  one...

	* Modified station plots so that the quadrant annotation (and thus 
	  associated active areas) are always present.

Thu Jan 27 09:37:04 1994  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* GraphicsW.c: Test for X shared memory extension now calls 
	  XShmQueryExtension() before trying to call XShmQueryVersion().
	  The latter generates a fatal X error if the extension is not in
	  the server, while the former just returns a boolean to tell whether
	  the extension is in place.

Wed Jan 26 08:30:57 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Added CFG_ parameters and project customizations to config.h.
	  Added the version.h header file to zeb/config.  Non-compiling
	  ingest modules were removed from the tree.

	* Conditional directory distribution, and the distfiles, 
	  distmakefiles, and distclean make targets.

	* ...and sometime before here GNU regexp was removed from libZeb.

Fri Jan 21 14:51:41 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Moved the print widget into the DM loadfile, since it's one of
	  those things we'll want everywhere.

Mon Jan  3 00:50:21 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Non-window, non-interactive option added to EventLogger.

	* DataChunk optimization, field and attribute types.  Numerous
	  DataStore fixes and enhancements, such as platform searches
	  and more flexible and efficient ZNF files.

Mon Dec 27 14:08:31 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagging V4.0beta2

Wed Dec 22 11:57:58 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Numerous tweaks to make things compile under Solaris despite the
	  best efforts of the #$#*$!! compiler.  Note that if, in the
	  future, you see "identifier redeclared" errors for functions,
	  check for float/double in the prototype...

Mon Dec 13 20:27:14 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Graphics widget can now handle shared memory failures: The
	  graphics process will work whether shared memory is compiled on
	  or off, whether the X server supports the extension or not, and
	  whether the system kernel supports shared memory or not (or even
	  sufficient shared memory).

	* The GNU regexp library functions were added to the Zeb library.

Thu Dec  2 15:27:54 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagging version 4.0beta1

Thu Dec  2 10:15:38 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* In XY plots, moved overlay times widget update and side annotation 
	  drawing so that they show correct times for each platform.  
	  Previously, the last platform's end time would be shown for all 
	  platforms in a given component.


Wed Dec  1 10:41:12 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* MAJOR thrashing of the entire set of XY modules.  Just about 
	  everything changed to a pretty significant degree, so I won't try
	  to elaborate on the changes.  If at all possible, try not to dredge 
	  up anything from previous versions of the code...  The old 
	  xdr_infinity.h header file disappears with this version.  ARM's
	  xy graph problems (grid being plotted over data, etc.) should be
	  addressed by these changes.

	* PlotPrim.c received a code cleaning with some simplification.  
	  Prototypes have been moved to the new PlotPrim.h to make them 
	  available to external modules.  Routines previously named with 
	  a gp_ prefix have been renamed with a pp_ prefix to make them 
	  easier to find.

	* Changes to PlotExec.c so that axes are no longer drawn at this 
	  level (i.e., the call to ac_DisplayAxes() is gone), but axis resets 
	  are now done here when a global replot takes place (i.e., we call 
	  ac_ResetAxes()).  Axis space allocation via lc_SetAxisSpace() has
	  been simplified.

	* In PlotControl.c, changed pc_UnZoom() so that it now only replots 
	  if an unzoom actually happens.  The replot event is also now done as
	  an Override rather than an Augment.

	* Major code cleaning in LayoutControl.c and LayoutControl.h.  Just 
	  about everything changed to some degree or other.  GraphProc.c 
	  gained a call to lc_Init() to get everything initialized.

	* In Icons.c, added a sanity clause to I_PositionIcon() to bail out 
	  if it doesn't get a good pixmap.

	* Simplification and restucturing of the axis control code.  The
	  main interface to the outside world now consists of ac_ResetAxes() 
	  and ac_PlotAxes().  Other routines, such as ac_GetComponentAxes(), 
	  ac_QueryAxisState(), ac_UpdateAxisState(), and ac_AxisSide() have 
	  gone away.

	* In Annotate.c, simplified An_ColorScale() somewhat and changed 
	  An_XYGString() to use I_PositionIcon().

Thu Nov 18 09:25:51 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* More dm changes, mostly more command line functions.

	* Added the "startzeb" script in src/etc.  It gets slightly
          massaged and installed into /zeb/bin.  My hope is that this
          script will do away with the need for lots of customized,
          project-specific startup scripts.  Just about everything is
          tweakable through environment variables, and it will pull in a
          project-specific tweaking file if it exists.

Mon Nov 15 14:07:07 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Fixed a stale memory bug that caused occasional random color
	  table weirdness.  As far as I can tell, this bug has been there
	  since 1991.

	* Added a variable CTablePath in dm which is used to load up color
	  tables at request time.  Also added .../src/etc/colortables to
	  hold the usual crowd of color table files.

Tue Nov  9 16:01:22 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@stout)

	* Numerous small bug fixes, mostly nasty array overruns and the
	  like in active areas, plot exec.

Fri Nov  5 15:00:25 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Tagging version V3-5.

Thu Nov  4 09:24:43 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Fixed a "never should have worked" bug in dsmanage when loading
	data from CD.  Also changed the default CD name to "/cd".

Wed Oct 27 14:18:01 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Lots and lots of changes for the HPUX port.

	* Added the ability write a single, large, combined data store
	cache file which contains all platforms.  If the daemon config file
	defines the variable "ConfigFile", it is expected to the the name
	of one of these big files and loaded according; in this case, any
	per-platform cache files are IGNORED.

	Wonder why we would want to do this?  Essentially it's for CDROM
	users who (1) want to get going faster, and (2) want to be able to
	use a newer version of the software without enduring lots of "cache
	version mismatch" messages and a 20-minute daemon startup...

Mon Oct 18 13:30:43 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Numerous active area tweaks, especially with station plots.  You
	may now click on the field annotation to easily change what appears
	in each quad (given the right configuration, of course).

Fri Oct 15 10:31:25 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added active areas to xygraph annotation.

	* Fixed the "vanishing annotation" problem that appeared in numerous
	CAP plot types when the scale value was > 1.

	* Demoted some annoying xygraph babble to EF_DEBUG

Thu Oct 14 14:12:27 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added the "active areas" capability to gp.  Active areas are
	essentially icons which appear within the graphics windows, and
	which can have menus attached to them.  They are not implemented
	like the base icons, though, in that they are not separate widgets
	(for performance reasons).  So far, station plots, lightning,
	boundaries, and tracks can have active icons.

	* Added some CLF's to dm: NthColor to get the Nth color out of a
	color table; nvalue to get the number of (comma-separated) values
	for a PD parameter; pd_complist to return a foreach-able list of
	components from a PD.

Thu Oct  7 10:07:52 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added the "plot-hold" parameter.  If present in the global 
	component, and true, no plotting will be done.  The purpose is
	to allow the tweaking of multiple parameters from dm (or from
	icons, eventually) without replots happening in the middle.

	* Reworked xygraph (simple) side annotation to be more useful and
	legible.  Time stamps still appear, but may be disabled by setting
	[xy-]time-annot to false.

	* Added a function ParseLine to do what CommaParse does, but with
	an arbitrary delimiter.  Then made CommaParse use it.

Fri Oct  1 15:03:37 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/Annotate.c: Fixed An_ColorNumber() so it works correctly for 
	color tables with an even number of colors.  Andy's change a while
	ago to reverse the order of the labels worked correctly only for
	color tables with an odd number of colors.

Thu Sep 30 15:45:16 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Fixed dc_NSpace.c bug where static field data got overwritten
	unless added first or last to the DataChunk.

	* netCDF improvements: add null terminators to att strings, create
	the conventional field atts (long_name, etc) first, accept 
	missing_value's of non-float type

	* moved emacs local variables in ChangeLog to bottom of file, where
	it won't get messed up by add-change-log-entry; extended the 
	outline-regexp expression---change it back if you don't like it

Mon Sep 27 14:37:10 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Fixed a memory leak associated with the plot description
	monitoring system.  Testcenter is good for something after all.

	* Allow the specification of only a single field for "simple"
	xygraphs, even in the presence of multiple platforms.  The obvious
	thing is done.  Fixed a bug with the old attempt to provide this
	behavior with "time".

	* Removed most widgets from the "GraphProc.widgets" file.  They
	are now autoloaded through the "require" mechanism.

	* Added autoscaling to contour plots and color-coded track plots.
	If "scale-mode" is "auto", center and step values will be
	determined automatically.  Default is not to do this, so that old
	PD's don't start acting in new, unexpected ways.

	* Added new CL functions PDParam and PDSearch which function just
	like the old pd_param and pd_paramsearch, but which only return
	parameters as strings and thus do not need the final data type
	argument.

	* Added an "extras" capability to the FieldMenu so that non-field
	options can be presented in the menu.  Used for adding "station"
	to station plots and so on.

	* Added the "require" capability to load chunks of UI code once
	when actually needed.


Mon Sep 20 11:21:41 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp
	Vector representation is now supported on cross-section plots.
	This involved an *extensive* thrashing of the way XSection.c does
	its work, so this revision will be a significant source of
	potential bugs.  Testing hasn't turned up anything, though, so I
	have my fingers crossed.
	

Thu Sep 16 10:38:41 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp
	Contour and FilledContour now create only one GC each, rather than
	creating a new one for each contour drawn.  

	* gp
	Annotations generated by routines in Annotate.c now put them a 
	couple of pixels further to the right, so they don't overlay the 
	edge of the plotting area.

Thu Sep  9 11:40:27 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* dm: fixed a bug introduced by a previous change wherein a
	restarted window would no longer keep its PD, but would instead
	revert back to the original one.

	(NOTE) If the "*" line contains a good line-line description
	of the changes, nice things can be done with outline mode in
	emacs...

Tue Sep  7 17:01:13 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* EventLogger: Popup window for controlling a log file and the
	log file's event mask separately.

Thu Sep  2 02:38:57 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* DataStore: ds_DeleteObs() added, ds_DeleteData() bug fixed
	New API function ds_DeleteObs().  Bug fixes for ds_ForceRescan() and
	ds_DeleteData().  Improvements to ZNF block overwrites and file growth.

	* dsdelete: Allows deletion of specific observations by absolute time.

Thu Aug 26 14:14:14 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* gp
	Added MapPath and IconPath (both internal and UI indirect variables)
	as search paths for icons and maps.  Default value for IconPath is
	"/zeb/lib/icons,./icons" (/zeb/lib is really the library directory, of
	course); for MapPath it's "/zeb/lib,./maps".

	* dm
	Carved out the FindFile routine.

	* zeb library
	Added the FindFile routine to the zeb library.
	Useful for digging through a series of directories looking for a
	file.

Fri Aug 13 13:09:00 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* ZNF now has block append and overwrite capability through 
	ds_StoreBlocks(), but overwrite efficiency is limited to always
	storing the same fields in the file.

Thu Aug  5 12:18:02 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagged revision V3-4

	* data store, dsdelete
	dsdelete now takes an absolute date instead of an offset for
	deletion.  Offsets are still handled, but go from the current time
	(as known by the timer) rather than the latest file date.
	ds_Store refuses to store data way in the future.  ("Way"
	determined by the number of seconds in the MaxFuture indirect
	variable -- default one hour).

Wed Aug  4 11:45:44 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@stout)

	* Zeb now compiles under SunOS 5.0 (Solaris), using GNU's gcc and
	MIT's X11R5.

Thu Jul 29 10:56:37 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagged revision V3-3.

	* XY*.c and config.h
	Lots of character arrays in XY*.c were hardcoded at 80, which was
	found (the hard way) to be too short for the ARM folks.  I added
	some parameters to the end of config.h that can be changed, and
	set up the XYgraph routines to use them.

Mon Jul 26 13:49:47 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* ingest/satellite/SatIngest.c
	There is now a "truncate" option that allows multi-byte data to
	be ingested by lopping off all but the highest order byte of
	the data.  Previously, only one byte data could be ingested.

Fri Jul 23 14:22:03 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/XYGraph.c
	Restored date of data to side annotation at Charlie Martin's
	request.

Wed Jul 21 09:56:31 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* dsdwidget
	Date is now shown on end times as well as begin times for files in
	the platform_data widget, since the files may span multiple days.

Tue Jul 20 14:08:44 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* message
	Fixed an omission wherein the unix domain socket would fail to be
	removed if ZEB_SOCKET was defined.

Fri Jul 16 10:06:57 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* ds
	F_DeclareField now refuses (silently) to overwrite an existing
	field definition.  This change was needed to keep long
	descriptions from getting lost when the netCDF module defines
	fields found in a file.

	* gp
	Added a new magic pulldown menu called "FieldMenu."  This one will
	automatically generate a set of available fields and display it in
	the menu.  The user may then use the menu to change to a new field.

Tue Jul 13 19:59:31 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/XSection.c
	New plot description parameters "z-min" and "z-max" have been added
	to control the vertical limits of cross section plots.

Tue Jul 13 15:21:39 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Everything:
	V3-2 tagged and shipped out to ARM.

Fri Jul  9 00:03:51 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@steam)

	* DataStore: ds_StoreBlocks()
	ds_StoreBlocks() bug fixed which improperly handled the addition
	of new files prior to existing data files.

	* DataStore: 'maxsamples' bug
	Fixed bug which allowed more than 'maxsamples' samples to be
	written to a platform's data file.

	* Added the ChangeLog file to the top-level directory of Zeb.  All
	major changes and bug fixes in any part of Zeb will be mentioned
	in this file.  This file lists a history of changes of importance
	and interest to the end user.
