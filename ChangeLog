	* Zeb now compiles under SunOS 5.0 (Solaris), using GNU's gcc and
	MIT's X11R5.

	* Tagged revision V3-3.

	* XY*.c and config.h
	Lots of character arrays in XY*.c were hardcoded at 80, which was
	found (the hard way) to be too short for the ARM folks.  I added
	some parameters to the end of config.h that can be changed, and
	set up the XYgraph routines to use them.

	* ingest/satellite/SatIngest.c
	There is now a "truncate" option that allows multi-byte data to
	be ingested by lopping off all but the highest order byte of
	the data.  Previously, only one byte data could be ingested.

	* gp/XYGraph.c
	Restored date of data to side annotation at Charlie Martin's
	request.

	* dsdwidget
	Date is now shown on end times as well as begin times for files in
	the platform_data widget, since the files may span multiple days.

	* message
	Fixed an omission wherein the unix domain socket would fail to be
	removed if ZEB_SOCKET was defined.

	* ds
	F_DeclareField now refuses (silently) to overwrite an existing
	field definition.  This change was needed to keep long
	descriptions from getting lost when the netCDF module defines
	fields found in a file.

	* gp
	Added a new magic pulldown menu called "FieldMenu."  This one will
	automatically generate a set of available fields and display it in
	the menu.  The user may then use the menu to change to a new field.

	* gp/XSection.c
	New plot description parameters "z-min" and "z-max" have been added
	to control the vertical limits of cross section plots.

	* Everything:
	V3-2 tagged and shipped out to ARM.

Fri Jul  9 00:03:51 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@steam)

	* DataStore:
	ds_StoreBlocks() bug fixed which improperly handled the addition
	of new files prior to existing data files.

	* DataStore: 
	Fixed bug which allowed more than 'maxsamples' samples to be
	written to a platform's data file.

	* Added the ChangeLog file to the top-level directory of Zeb.  All
	major changes and bug fixes in any part of Zeb will be mentioned
	in this file.  This file lists a history of changes of importance
	and interest to the end user.
