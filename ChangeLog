Mon May 23 20:50:35 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@steam)

	* --- Branch_LANTEX changes ---

	* TimeSeries.c: fixed a bug in axis tic labels which I introduced
	  in the Solaris port

	* lib: add msg_myname() function to msg_lib.c, use this to set
	  c$msgname in SetupConfigVariables(); used by gp to send its 
	  boundary to another window

	* config.h.dist: removed /*/ constructs, inserted default defn
	  for XCOMM, use UNQUOTED_DIRDEFS instead of MAKING_MAKEFILE

	* Ingest state files: changed /rdss/ui/ui_commands to #ui$defs_file

	* dm: SaveConfig() uses DM_GEOMETRY to query clients for geometry
	  info (retrieved from top-level-shell resources: location is WM
	  parent window location, size is the size of the shell window 
	  itself); tested under olwm and vtwm.  Re-arranged message types
	  in dm protocol since there was some overlap.

	* dm: fixed bug in KillProcess which would accidentally remove
	  windows from a configuration; added 'reuse' and 'rename' options
	  to dm newwindow command: rename generates unique window names 
	  automatically

	* gp: fixed station plots to correlate with side annotation
	  quadrant active areas

	* message.c: MTAP case moved *above* MT_PING so that pings which
	  fall through don't fall into MT_TAP.  Accept both MT_PING and
	  MT_CPING for pings to the message handler, since the handler
	  checks for its own name anyway.

	* zmon.c and msg_ping.c: Send MT_CPING in all cases, regardless of
	  whether pinging a message client or the handler itself.  Zmon
	  now accepts redundant host and process names in the config file.

	* '/' in platform names removed to get cache file names.

	* Archiver: tar command line now limited to what fits into the
	  command line buffer; dumpdate method improved

	* ConfigVars.c: tries Basedir/project/ZEB_PROJECT first, and if no
	  access tries Basedir/ZEB_PROJECT, and finally resorts to "." if
	  necessary.  If ZEB_PROJECT begins with a '/', accept the value
	  as an absolute path to the project directory.

	* icons: use $(INSTALL) to overwrite read-only installed files

Thu May 19 19:59:00 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* dm: Define plot descriptions with dm commands.  Configs saved
	  as a single file, complete with plot descriptions.  Includes new
	  'showpd' command.

Wed May 11 17:45:05 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* ds: Platform class and instance hierarchies added.  Primitive
	  debugging options.  More stats in query responses.

Mon May  9 16:42:08 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* dm: Replaced the obnoxious old "new window" widget with a
	  simpler one.  "Popup OldNewWindow" to get the old version.

	* gp: Added the option to activate the field names in xygraph 
	  (simple) side annotation.

	  Fixed an ugly bug in XYContour which would produce a color bar
	  on the side with random numbers.

Tue May  3 10:34:32 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* message: will no longer create and listen on an internet socket
	  unless the -i flag is present.

Tue Apr 26 14:23:08 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* gp: fixed a problem with the field menu when used from annot
	  active areas.

	* DFA_NetCDF.c: fixed a nasty free(random) bug.  Chalk up another
	  one for testcenter

Fri Mar 18 09:42:56 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* dm.c: Reset tbspace back to 0 by default.  My other change was
	  rather ill-advised.

Fri Mar  4 14:30:48 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

        * Fixed an unitialized variable problem in dsDaemon that would
	  cause lots of ugly garbage on the screen on exit, occasionally.

Mon Feb 14 09:29:49 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* ActiveArea.c Fixed a silly off-by-one error that was causing
	  unsightly core dumps.

	* FrameCache.c: Thrashed up and cleaned the code; no functionality
	  change.

Thu Feb 10 14:08:45 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* AxisControl.c: fix a couple of XDrawLine calls which were trying
	  to pass floating-point coordinates.

        * There is some confusion about what should be done in
	  px_GlobalPlot and what belongs elsewhere.  I have moved some
	  stuff around so that the right thing happens in the right order.
	  This code needs some review in the future...

Thu Feb  3 14:45:32 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@steam)

	* Tagging version V4.0.

Wed Feb  2 15:31:43 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* config: config.h promises that if you're using openwin and you
	  don't specify XIncDir that it will pick the open windows include
	  directory, but it warn't so.

	  Changed the strings /**/# to XCOMM, since the former produced an
	  intolerable number of gripes from the solaris compiler.

Tue Feb  1 13:44:06 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

        * Dsmanage: some solaris tweaks so that free space gets calculated
	  right.  Also it now looks for the ZEB_CDROM environment variable
	  to find the CDROM, if any.

Tue Feb  1 11:38:24 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@steam)

	* Fixed a NASTY free-unallocated-memory bug in XYWind.c.  If it 
	  weren't for TestCenter, I don't know how I would have found this
	  one...

	* Modified station plots so that the quadrant annotation (and thus 
	  associated active areas) are always present.

Thu Jan 27 09:37:04 1994  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* GraphicsW.c: Test for X shared memory extension now calls 
	  XShmQueryExtension() before trying to call XShmQueryVersion().
	  The latter generates a fatal X error if the extension is not in
	  the server, while the former just returns a boolean to tell whether
	  the extension is in place.

Wed Jan 26 08:30:57 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Added CFG_ parameters and project customizations to config.h.
	  Added the version.h header file to zeb/config.  Non-compiling
	  ingest modules were removed from the tree.

	* Conditional directory distribution, and the distfiles, 
	  distmakefiles, and distclean make targets.

	* ...and sometime before here GNU regexp was removed from libZeb.

Fri Jan 21 14:51:41 1994  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Moved the print widget into the DM loadfile, since it's one of
	  those things we'll want everywhere.

Mon Jan  3 00:50:21 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Non-window, non-interactive option added to EventLogger.

	* DataChunk optimization, field and attribute types.  Numerous
	  DataStore fixes and enhancements, such as platform searches
	  and more flexible and efficient ZNF files.

Mon Dec 27 14:08:31 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagging V4.0beta2

Wed Dec 22 11:57:58 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Numerous tweaks to make things compile under Solaris despite the
	  best efforts of the #$#*$!! compiler.  Note that if, in the
	  future, you see "identifier redeclared" errors for functions,
	  check for float/double in the prototype...

Mon Dec 13 20:27:14 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Graphics widget can now handle shared memory failures: The
	  graphics process will work whether shared memory is compiled on
	  or off, whether the X server supports the extension or not, and
	  whether the system kernel supports shared memory or not (or even
	  sufficient shared memory).

	* The GNU regexp library functions were added to the Zeb library.

Thu Dec  2 15:27:54 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagging version 4.0beta1

Thu Dec  2 10:15:38 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* In XY plots, moved overlay times widget update and side annotation 
	  drawing so that they show correct times for each platform.  
	  Previously, the last platform's end time would be shown for all 
	  platforms in a given component.


Wed Dec  1 10:41:12 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* MAJOR thrashing of the entire set of XY modules.  Just about 
	  everything changed to a pretty significant degree, so I won't try
	  to elaborate on the changes.  If at all possible, try not to dredge 
	  up anything from previous versions of the code...  The old 
	  xdr_infinity.h header file disappears with this version.  ARM's
	  xy graph problems (grid being plotted over data, etc.) should be
	  addressed by these changes.

	* PlotPrim.c received a code cleaning with some simplification.  
	  Prototypes have been moved to the new PlotPrim.h to make them 
	  available to external modules.  Routines previously named with 
	  a gp_ prefix have been renamed with a pp_ prefix to make them 
	  easier to find.

	* Changes to PlotExec.c so that axes are no longer drawn at this 
	  level (i.e., the call to ac_DisplayAxes() is gone), but axis resets 
	  are now done here when a global replot takes place (i.e., we call 
	  ac_ResetAxes()).  Axis space allocation via lc_SetAxisSpace() has
	  been simplified.

	* In PlotControl.c, changed pc_UnZoom() so that it now only replots 
	  if an unzoom actually happens.  The replot event is also now done as
	  an Override rather than an Augment.

	* Major code cleaning in LayoutControl.c and LayoutControl.h.  Just 
	  about everything changed to some degree or other.  GraphProc.c 
	  gained a call to lc_Init() to get everything initialized.

	* In Icons.c, added a sanity clause to I_PositionIcon() to bail out 
	  if it doesn't get a good pixmap.

	* Simplification and restucturing of the axis control code.  The
	  main interface to the outside world now consists of ac_ResetAxes() 
	  and ac_PlotAxes().  Other routines, such as ac_GetComponentAxes(), 
	  ac_QueryAxisState(), ac_UpdateAxisState(), and ac_AxisSide() have 
	  gone away.

	* In Annotate.c, simplified An_ColorScale() somewhat and changed 
	  An_XYGString() to use I_PositionIcon().

Thu Nov 18 09:25:51 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* More dm changes, mostly more command line functions.

	* Added the "startzeb" script in src/etc.  It gets slightly
          massaged and installed into /zeb/bin.  My hope is that this
          script will do away with the need for lots of customized,
          project-specific startup scripts.  Just about everything is
          tweakable through environment variables, and it will pull in a
          project-specific tweaking file if it exists.

Mon Nov 15 14:07:07 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Fixed a stale memory bug that caused occasional random color
	  table weirdness.  As far as I can tell, this bug has been there
	  since 1991.

	* Added a variable CTablePath in dm which is used to load up color
	  tables at request time.  Also added .../src/etc/colortables to
	  hold the usual crowd of color table files.

Tue Nov  9 16:01:22 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@stout)

	* Numerous small bug fixes, mostly nasty array overruns and the
	  like in active areas, plot exec.

Fri Nov  5 15:00:25 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Tagging version V3-5.

Thu Nov  4 09:24:43 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Fixed a "never should have worked" bug in dsmanage when loading
	data from CD.  Also changed the default CD name to "/cd".

Wed Oct 27 14:18:01 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Lots and lots of changes for the HPUX port.

	* Added the ability write a single, large, combined data store
	cache file which contains all platforms.  If the daemon config file
	defines the variable "ConfigFile", it is expected to the the name
	of one of these big files and loaded according; in this case, any
	per-platform cache files are IGNORED.

	Wonder why we would want to do this?  Essentially it's for CDROM
	users who (1) want to get going faster, and (2) want to be able to
	use a newer version of the software without enduring lots of "cache
	version mismatch" messages and a 20-minute daemon startup...

Mon Oct 18 13:30:43 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Numerous active area tweaks, especially with station plots.  You
	may now click on the field annotation to easily change what appears
	in each quad (given the right configuration, of course).

Fri Oct 15 10:31:25 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added active areas to xygraph annotation.

	* Fixed the "vanishing annotation" problem that appeared in numerous
	CAP plot types when the scale value was > 1.

	* Demoted some annoying xygraph babble to EF_DEBUG

Thu Oct 14 14:12:27 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added the "active areas" capability to gp.  Active areas are
	essentially icons which appear within the graphics windows, and
	which can have menus attached to them.  They are not implemented
	like the base icons, though, in that they are not separate widgets
	(for performance reasons).  So far, station plots, lightning,
	boundaries, and tracks can have active icons.

	* Added some CLF's to dm: NthColor to get the Nth color out of a
	color table; nvalue to get the number of (comma-separated) values
	for a PD parameter; pd_complist to return a foreach-able list of
	components from a PD.

Thu Oct  7 10:07:52 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Added the "plot-hold" parameter.  If present in the global 
	component, and true, no plotting will be done.  The purpose is
	to allow the tweaking of multiple parameters from dm (or from
	icons, eventually) without replots happening in the middle.

	* Reworked xygraph (simple) side annotation to be more useful and
	legible.  Time stamps still appear, but may be disabled by setting
	[xy-]time-annot to false.

	* Added a function ParseLine to do what CommaParse does, but with
	an arbitrary delimiter.  Then made CommaParse use it.

Fri Oct  1 15:03:37 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/Annotate.c: Fixed An_ColorNumber() so it works correctly for 
	color tables with an even number of colors.  Andy's change a while
	ago to reverse the order of the labels worked correctly only for
	color tables with an odd number of colors.

Thu Sep 30 15:45:16 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* Fixed dc_NSpace.c bug where static field data got overwritten
	unless added first or last to the DataChunk.

	* netCDF improvements: add null terminators to att strings, create
	the conventional field atts (long_name, etc) first, accept 
	missing_value's of non-float type

	* moved emacs local variables in ChangeLog to bottom of file, where
	it won't get messed up by add-change-log-entry; extended the 
	outline-regexp expression---change it back if you don't like it

Mon Sep 27 14:37:10 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Fixed a memory leak associated with the plot description
	monitoring system.  Testcenter is good for something after all.

	* Allow the specification of only a single field for "simple"
	xygraphs, even in the presence of multiple platforms.  The obvious
	thing is done.  Fixed a bug with the old attempt to provide this
	behavior with "time".

	* Removed most widgets from the "GraphProc.widgets" file.  They
	are now autoloaded through the "require" mechanism.

	* Added autoscaling to contour plots and color-coded track plots.
	If "scale-mode" is "auto", center and step values will be
	determined automatically.  Default is not to do this, so that old
	PD's don't start acting in new, unexpected ways.

	* Added new CL functions PDParam and PDSearch which function just
	like the old pd_param and pd_paramsearch, but which only return
	parameters as strings and thus do not need the final data type
	argument.

	* Added an "extras" capability to the FieldMenu so that non-field
	options can be presented in the menu.  Used for adding "station"
	to station plots and so on.

	* Added the "require" capability to load chunks of UI code once
	when actually needed.


Mon Sep 20 11:21:41 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp
	Vector representation is now supported on cross-section plots.
	This involved an *extensive* thrashing of the way XSection.c does
	its work, so this revision will be a significant source of
	potential bugs.  Testing hasn't turned up anything, though, so I
	have my fingers crossed.
	

Thu Sep 16 10:38:41 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp
	Contour and FilledContour now create only one GC each, rather than
	creating a new one for each contour drawn.  

	* gp
	Annotations generated by routines in Annotate.c now put them a 
	couple of pixels further to the right, so they don't overlay the 
	edge of the plotting area.

Thu Sep  9 11:40:27 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* dm: fixed a bug introduced by a previous change wherein a
	restarted window would no longer keep its PD, but would instead
	revert back to the original one.

	(NOTE) If the "*" line contains a good line-line description
	of the changes, nice things can be done with outline mode in
	emacs...

Tue Sep  7 17:01:13 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* EventLogger: Popup window for controlling a log file and the
	log file's event mask separately.

Thu Sep  2 02:38:57 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* DataStore: ds_DeleteObs() added, ds_DeleteData() bug fixed
	New API function ds_DeleteObs().  Bug fixes for ds_ForceRescan() and
	ds_DeleteData().  Improvements to ZNF block overwrites and file growth.

	* dsdelete: Allows deletion of specific observations by absolute time.

Thu Aug 26 14:14:14 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* gp
	Added MapPath and IconPath (both internal and UI indirect variables)
	as search paths for icons and maps.  Default value for IconPath is
	"/zeb/lib/icons,./icons" (/zeb/lib is really the library directory, of
	course); for MapPath it's "/zeb/lib,./maps".

	* dm
	Carved out the FindFile routine.

	* zeb library
	Added the FindFile routine to the zeb library.
	Useful for digging through a series of directories looking for a
	file.

Fri Aug 13 13:09:00 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* ZNF now has block append and overwrite capability through 
	ds_StoreBlocks(), but overwrite efficiency is limited to always
	storing the same fields in the file.

Thu Aug  5 12:18:02 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagged revision V3-4

	* data store, dsdelete
	dsdelete now takes an absolute date instead of an offset for
	deletion.  Offsets are still handled, but go from the current time
	(as known by the timer) rather than the latest file date.
	ds_Store refuses to store data way in the future.  ("Way"
	determined by the number of seconds in the MaxFuture indirect
	variable -- default one hour).

Wed Aug  4 11:45:44 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@stout)

	* Zeb now compiles under SunOS 5.0 (Solaris), using GNU's gcc and
	MIT's X11R5.

Thu Jul 29 10:56:37 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Tagged revision V3-3.

	* XY*.c and config.h
	Lots of character arrays in XY*.c were hardcoded at 80, which was
	found (the hard way) to be too short for the ARM folks.  I added
	some parameters to the end of config.h that can be changed, and
	set up the XYgraph routines to use them.

Mon Jul 26 13:49:47 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* ingest/satellite/SatIngest.c
	There is now a "truncate" option that allows multi-byte data to
	be ingested by lopping off all but the highest order byte of
	the data.  Previously, only one byte data could be ingested.

Fri Jul 23 14:22:03 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/XYGraph.c
	Restored date of data to side annotation at Charlie Martin's
	request.

Wed Jul 21 09:56:31 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* dsdwidget
	Date is now shown on end times as well as begin times for files in
	the platform_data widget, since the files may span multiple days.

Tue Jul 20 14:08:44 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* message
	Fixed an omission wherein the unix domain socket would fail to be
	removed if ZEB_SOCKET was defined.

Fri Jul 16 10:06:57 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* ds
	F_DeclareField now refuses (silently) to overwrite an existing
	field definition.  This change was needed to keep long
	descriptions from getting lost when the netCDF module defines
	fields found in a file.

	* gp
	Added a new magic pulldown menu called "FieldMenu."  This one will
	automatically generate a set of available fields and display it in
	the menu.  The user may then use the menu to change to a new field.

Tue Jul 13 19:59:31 1993  Chris Burghart  (burghart@trenco)

	* gp/XSection.c
	New plot description parameters "z-min" and "z-max" have been added
	to control the vertical limits of cross section plots.

Tue Jul 13 15:21:39 1993  Jonathan Corbet  (corbet@ale)

	* Everything:
	V3-2 tagged and shipped out to ARM.

Fri Jul  9 00:03:51 1993  Gary Granger  (granger@steam)

	* DataStore: ds_StoreBlocks()
	ds_StoreBlocks() bug fixed which improperly handled the addition
	of new files prior to existing data files.

	* DataStore: 'maxsamples' bug
	Fixed bug which allowed more than 'maxsamples' samples to be
	written to a platform's data file.

	* Added the ChangeLog file to the top-level directory of Zeb.  All
	major changes and bug fixes in any part of Zeb will be mentioned
	in this file.  This file lists a history of changes of importance
	and interest to the end user.
